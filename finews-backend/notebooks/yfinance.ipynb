Are Both Stocks Buys?Geoffrey Seiler, The Motley FoolSun, Jan 26, 2025, 8:30 PM6 min readLink Copied0Analysts at Jefferies recently ranked the so-called \"Magnificent Seven\" stocks based on which ones they thought would outperform in 2025. The name refers to a group of leading mega-cap tech stocks that have been helping lead the market higher the past couple of years.Its top picks among the group were Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) and Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOGL) (NASDAQ: GOOG). The group also includes, by order of Jefferies\\' rankings, Meta Platforms, Apple, Amazon, Tesla, and Microsoft.The firm\\'s rankings were based on several quantitative measures, including growth, valuation, yield, earnings revisions, sell-side analyst sentiment, return on invested capital (ROIC), stock price momentum, and research and development (R&D) versus capex (capital expenditures) spending.Nvidia grabbed the top spot largely due to its strong growth, upward guidance revisions, attractive valuation, and strong analyst sentiment.Let\\'s look at why I think both Nvidia and Alphabet stocks are attractive buys.1. NvidiaNvidia remains a great combination of incredibly strong growth at an attractive valuation. The company is on pace to report its second consecutive year of triple-digit revenue increases, which given its size is quite remarkable.Meanwhile, analysts are projecting more than 50% sales growth in 2025. And it is attractively valued with a forward price-to-earnings ratio (P/E) below 33 times and a price/earnings-to-growth ratio (PEG) of 1. PEGs below 1 are generally considered undervalued, although growth stocks will often have PEGs well above 1.Nvidia\\'s growth comes from a combination of the frantic buildout of artificial intelligence (AI) infrastructure and the wide moat the company has created through its CUDA software platform. Its graphics processing units (GPUs), which were originally created to speed up graphics rendering in video games, have become the backbone of AI infrastructure given their superior processing speeds.As large tech companies and AI start-ups rush to improve their AI models, they need more and more computing power to train them, which is largely coming from GPUs. Through Nvidia\\'s CUDA X collection of libraries, tools, and microservices, its semiconductors are easily programmable for various AI tasks, which has allowed it to take a nearly 90% market share in the GPU space.Elon Musk\\'s xAI is a great example of the growing use of GPUs in AI model training. The company used 20,000 GPUs to train its Grok 2 model, while it originally was using 100,000 GPUs to train its Grok 3 model, but then increased it to 200,000 for phase two of its training. Meanwhile, Musk has talked about xAI\\'s data center hosting a 1 million GPU cluster in the future.Story continuesMeanwhile, Nvidia\\'s largest customer, Microsoft, announced it will spend $80 billion on AI data centers this year. Not to be outdone, a consortium consisting of Oracle, SoftBank Group, and OpenAI has discussed spending up to $500 billion on AI infrastructure in Texas as part of the recently announced Project Stargate.A lot of this spending will undoubtedly go toward GPUs. These projects demonstrate the type of growth still ahead for Nvidia.Image source: Getty Images.2. AlphabetWhile no mega-cap company can come close to matching Nvidia\\'s recent growth, Alphabet is a strong growing company that has the cheapest valuation among the Magnificent Seven with a forward P/E of only 19.4.Last quarter, Alphabet grew its revenue a solid 15%, while its profits soared 34% and its earnings per share climbed 37%. The growth was led by its cloud computing division, Google Cloud, which grew its revenue by 35%.Cloud computing is a business with very high fixed costs that has a lot of operating leverage once the business reaches scale. That was seen in its last quarter, when the segment saw a profitability inflection point, with segment operating income surging from $266 million a year ago to $1.95 billion.With organizations scampering to build out their own AI models and applications, expect this business to continue to grow strongly as Alphabet adds more data center capacity. Meanwhile, the company could see even more operating leverage as it has developed its own custom AI chips with the help of Broadcom, which it has said in combination with GPUs is helping reduce AI inference processing times and lowering costs.As it continues to scale up as the smallest of the big-three cloud computing companies and with its custom chip advantage, Google Cloud\\'s margins should continue to improve, leading to strong earnings growth.At the same time, Alphabet owns the world\\'s dominant search engine in Google and YouTube, the most viewed streaming platform globally. These businesses continue to grow revenue by double digits, with sales for its overall Google Services segment climbing 13% last quarter. Segment operating income soared 29% to $30.9 billion.The company is looking to incorporate its new Gemini AI model throughout its businesses this year to help drive growth, while also looking to promote its Gemini app, which is its answer to ChatGPT.Management also has other emerging businesses that it is investing in, including quantum computing, where it recently announced a big technological breakthrough. It also owns Waymo, which is currently the only company offering paid robotaxi rides in the U.S. These are presently money-losing business, but they have big potential.Overall, Alphabet is a nice combination of growth and value with some solid longer-term optionality with its investments in robotaxis and quantum computing.Don’t miss this second chance at a potentially lucrative opportunityEver feel like you missed the boat in buying the most successful stocks?

The answer was a shockingly low $3,625 at the time I crunched the numbers. Because Nvidia\\'s shares have risen over the last few days, the magic amount is even lower now.In my backward-looking exercise, I also examined what signs might have pointed to Nvidia\\'s potential for massive gains. And there were some good indications about the company\\'s prospects for anyone looking closely.But what about Nvidia\\'s prospects now? Where will the company and its stock be in 10 years? I won\\'t pretend to have any definitive answers. However, I\\'ll take a stab at where I think Nvidia will be in 2035.A prediction of Nvidia\\'s futureThe most important assumption I have about Nvidia\\'s future is that we\\'ve only seen the tip of the iceberg with how artificial intelligence (AI) will impact the world. I suspect more of the iceberg will be visible relatively soon, though, with the adoption of AI agents that can perform tasks autonomously.Could artificial general intelligence (AGI) be achieved within the next 10 years? Probably, depending on how you define AGI. I agree with Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang that AI models will be able to pass any test that humans can in five years or less. I wouldn\\'t go as far as predicting AI systems will be sentient (a criterion some have for AGI) by 2035, though.I fully expect Nvidia to remain a central player in AI over the next decade and beyond. The company\\'s new Blackwell GPU architecture -- which has the most powerful AI capabilities to date -- will likely seem painfully slow and unwieldy compared to what Nvidia will roll out 10 years from now.My future picture of Nvidia includes the company aggressively expanding into areas such as developing custom AI chips. I also think the autonomous ride-hailing market (robotaxis) will explode over the next few years, with Nvidia as one of the top beneficiaries.While AI is Nvidia\\'s biggest opportunity, in my opinion, I believe the company will also see tremendous growth thanks to the adoption of augmented reality (AR) and virtual reality (VR). AR and VR applications will require powerful graphics processors -- and no company is better at it than Nvidia.What could go wrong?Murphy\\'s Law can affect even the best companies. What could go wrong and derail my admittedly upbeat prediction about Nvidia\\'s future? Several things.Competition in the AI chip market will almost certainly increase significantly over the next 10 years. I expect Advanced Micro Devices will further step up its game. I\\'ll also keep my eyes on Nvidia\\'s big customers who have developed their own AI chips, including Google parent Alphabet, Amazon, and Microsoft.Story continuesPerhaps the most worrisome competition, though, could come from major technological breakthroughs by rivals. Nvidia\\'s Huang caused quantum computing stocks to plunge recently with his comments that practical quantum computers are probably 15 to 30 years away. That could be wishful thinking. I can envision a scenario where another company develops a quantum computer that\\'s more powerful for training and deploying AI models than Nvidia\\'s GPUs.As successful as it is (and I think will continue to be), Nvidia isn\\'t immune to macroeconomic factors. If the global economy enters into a deep, prolonged recession, the chipmaker might not grow nearly as much as I expect it will.I\\'d also be remiss without acknowledging that my optimism about the future of AI could be too pie in the sky. Maybe large language models (LLMs) could hit a performance plateau, with no better technologies emerging.The multitrillion-dollar questionSo far, I\\'ve only addressed where I think Nvidia\\'s business will be in 2035. But the multitrillion-dollar question is: Where will Nvidia stock be in 10 years?Before I attempt to answer this question, I\\'ll tell you what I don\\'t think will happen. Over the last 10 years, Nvidia\\'s share price has skyrocketed nearly 285 times higher. I don\\'t see the stock delivering anywhere near that kind of return over the next decade.However, as mentioned, I foresee major growth opportunities for Nvidia over the next 10 years in AI, robotaxis, and AR/VR. Could Nvidia\\'s compound annual growth rate (CAGR) be at least 15% during this period? I think it\\'s possible. If we assume a 15% CAGR, the stock would be a four-bagger by 2035, with a market cap of over $18 trillion.Admittedly, this prediction could be way too optimistic. But even if Nvidia delivers a much lower CAGR of 8%, its stock would more than double over the next decade and give the company a market cap of more than $11 trillion. Unless an unforeseen threat emerges that takes the wind out of Nvidia\\'s sails, the GPU maker\\'s future appears to be very bright.Don’t miss this second chance at a potentially lucrative opportunityEver feel like you missed the boat in buying the most successful stocks?

The semiconductor company is the leading seller of computer chips for artificial intelligence (AI) data centers, which are getting a huge boost in demand. Nvidia\\'s revenue and profits have soared in the last few years, with investors getting uber-bullish on the stock. As of this writing, Nvidia has a market cap of $3.46 trillion, making it the largest company in the world by market value.I think 2025 will be the year the Empire strikes back, with the rest of big tech regaining a negotiating foothold as semiconductor supply chains catch up with demand for AI products. Who will that benefit the most? My bet is Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN), the largest cloud computing company in the world, which is the backbone of many AI tools that are growing like gangbusters.Along with its dominant e-commerce operation, Amazon\\'s cloud computing division will allow it to finish 2025 with the largest market cap in the world. Here\\'s why.Steadily expanding profit marginsUnlike the rest of the big technology companies that already have sky-high profit margins, Amazon\\'s profitability is still vastly understated due to its propensity to invest for future growth. Last year, we started to see the company finally take its foot off the gas, a trend I think will continue in 2025.Over the last 12 months ending in September, Amazon posted an operating margin of 9.8%, a record high. Part of this is due to the Amazon Web Services (AWS) cloud computing segment, which had an operating margin of 35%. I expect AWS margins to remain strong, but the segment is still less than 20% of Amazon\\'s overall sales.Margin expansion is mainly coming from Amazon\\'s dominant North American e-commerce business, which posted an operating margin of 5.9% over the last 12 months. Still at a compressed level -- especially when you consider the tens of billions in high-margin third-party e-commerce fees, subscriptions, and advertising sales it brings in every year -- Amazon has plenty of room to bring segment profit margins even higher in 2025.While it won\\'t be an overnight story, Amazon can easily finish 2025 with a profit margin of 15% and most likely 20%, if it wants. The only question is how efficient its spending on research projects such as Alexa it will be.An artificial intelligence boom for the agesThere is a clear path to Amazon expanding its profit margins in 2025. There is also reason to believe it will keep accelerating revenue growth, especially at AWS.AWS\\'s net sales growth went from 12% in Q3 a year ago to 19% year-over-year growth last quarter. The boom in AI spending should continue in 2025, with capital expenditure budgets seemingly going up every day. This is a good thing for AWS, as more capital expenditures mean more demand for AI computing power, which means more revenue for AWS. In fact, famous investor Softbank announced it will be investing $100 billion in AI in the United States.\\xa0While all of this will not be spent on AWS data centers, the trend is here to stay.Story continuesIf AWS can grow its revenue by 30% over the next 12 months as more and more AI demand gets fulfilled, the division will reach $134 billion in sales and help accelerate Amazon\\'s consolidated revenue growth.NVDA Operating Income (TTM) data by YCharts.Why Amazon can finish 2025 as the largest company in the worldMy belief in Amazon finishing 2025 as the largest company in the world largely rests on an acceleration in revenue growth at AWS and consolidated profit margin expansion. Here\\'s the math that shows why this could occur.Amazon\\'s trailing 12-month revenue is $620 billion, with sales growing 11% year-over-year last quarter. If revenue growth can accelerate to 15% over the next 12 months, that will bring annual sales to $713 billion. It is a staggering size but shows the massive markets Amazon is going after in e-commerce, retail, and cloud computing.As I discussed above, there is room for Amazon to expand its operating margin to close to 20% in 2025. While I\\'m not confident it will hit exactly 20%, there should be high conviction in the general direction of this metric in 2025. If Amazon stopped investing in research projects, the company would likely have profit margins even higher than 20%.The 20% profit margins on $713 billion in revenue equals $142.6 billion in operating income. This is above the operating income generated by Nvidia, Apple, and Microsoft over the last 12 months. While not a guarantee, I think the company that generates the highest profit should have the largest market cap in the world, especially one with promising growth prospects such as Amazon. For this reason, I think Amazon will finish 2025 as the stock with the largest market cap in the world, making it a buy for your portfolio right now.Don’t miss this second chance at a potentially lucrative opportunityEver feel like you missed the boat in buying the most successful stocks?

Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) posted the biggest gain in the Dow Jones Industrial Average, and Palantir Technologies (NASDAQ: PLTR) delivered the top performance in the S&P 500. These players surged 171% and 340%, respectively.Why did investors pile into these stocks? Both have benefited from the artificial intelligence (AI) boom. Nvidia dominates the AI chip market, while Palantir uses AI as a key part of its software-as-a-service platform. As a result, revenue at both companies is soaring.After these successes, you may think it\\'s too late to get in on these top AI players. But we\\'re actually in the early days of the AI growth story, and these companies are well positioned to benefit through the next chapters. Let\\'s take a closer look at these two red-hot growth stocks that remain buys in 2025.Image source: Getty Images.1. NvidiaFirst, some background on this AI giant. Nvidia wasn\\'t always linked to AI. In its earlier days, it was known for its work with the video games industry. The company\\'s graphics processing units (GPUs) drove the lively images key to a great game (and they still do). But it soon became clear that GPUs could be useful in many other industries -- so Nvidia developed the CUDA parallel computing platform to make this a reality.Today, Nvidia serves various industries -- from healthcare to automobiles -- and its main focus is on AI. The data center business makes up the lion\\'s share of revenue, and it looks as if there\\'s a lot more growth to come. Here\\'s why. Nvidia will continue to benefit from the ongoing buildout of AI infrastructure, supplying GPUs and other products. For example, the U.S. just announced a new $500 billion AI infrastructure project and named Nvidia a key technology partner.On top of this, Nvidia is set to gain from the next wave of AI growth: applying AI to real-world situations. Agentic AI -- the use of AI agents to consider problems, reason, and apply solutions -- is a big part of that, and Nvidia has already taken steps here. The company offers blueprints for customers to design their own AI agents.So, today, trading for 49 times forward earnings estimates, Nvidia looks reasonably priced and makes a great growth buy for 2025 and beyond.2. Palantir TechnologiesTwenty-year-old Palantir was once known for its contracts with governments, its biggest customer group. But recently, a new growth driver has emerged: the commercial customer. Palantir sells software that aggregates a customer\\'s data and helps leverage that data to make often game-changing decisions.Story continuesThe company launched a new product, its Artificial Intelligence Platform (AIP), a little more than a year ago, and it\\'s helped this transition happen. AIP integrates AI into the data collection and decision-making processes. Palantir\\'s commercial customers,\\xa0totaling 14 just four years ago, have increased to about 300 -- concrete evidence that AIP is driving growth at Palantir.In even more good news, government revenue continues to increase, too, showing that the company now has two strong growth drivers. In the recent quarter, government and commercial revenue each climbed in the double digits, and Palantir reached its biggest profit ever.AIP is still a relatively new product, and the number of commercial customers today leaves plenty of room for growth. In addition, as mentioned, AI is still in its early stages of growth. Today\\'s $200 billion AI market may surpass $1 trillion by the end of the decade.And though Palantir looks expensive in relation to forward earnings estimates -- its forward price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio is 165 -- a metric that considers growth tells a different story. Palantir\\'s forward price/earnings-to-growth (PEG) ratio of 0.3 is reasonable, considering ratios of more than 1 suggest a stock is overvalued.\\xa0All of this means Palantir remains a solid buy for growth investors in 2025.Should you invest $1,000 in Nvidia right now?Before you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\\xa010 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Nvidia wasn’t one of them.

Are Both Stocks Buys?Geoffrey Seiler, The Motley FoolSun, Jan 26, 2025, 8:30 PM6 min readLink Copied0Analysts at Jefferies recently ranked the so-called \"Magnificent Seven\" stocks based on which ones they thought would outperform in 2025. The name refers to a group of leading mega-cap tech stocks that have been helping lead the market higher the past couple of years.Its top picks among the group were Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) and Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOGL) (NASDAQ: GOOG). The group also includes, by order of Jefferies\\' rankings, Meta Platforms, Apple, Amazon, Tesla, and Microsoft.The firm\\'s rankings were based on several quantitative measures, including growth, valuation, yield, earnings revisions, sell-side analyst sentiment, return on invested capital (ROIC), stock price momentum, and research and development (R&D) versus capex (capital expenditures) spending.Nvidia grabbed the top spot largely due to its strong growth, upward guidance revisions, attractive valuation, and strong analyst sentiment.Let\\'s look at why I think both Nvidia and Alphabet stocks are attractive buys.1. NvidiaNvidia remains a great combination of incredibly strong growth at an attractive valuation. The company is on pace to report its second consecutive year of triple-digit revenue increases, which given its size is quite remarkable.Meanwhile, analysts are projecting more than 50% sales growth in 2025. And it is attractively valued with a forward price-to-earnings ratio (P/E) below 33 times and a price/earnings-to-growth ratio (PEG) of 1. PEGs below 1 are generally considered undervalued, although growth stocks will often have PEGs well above 1.Nvidia\\'s growth comes from a combination of the frantic buildout of artificial intelligence (AI) infrastructure and the wide moat the company has created through its CUDA software platform. Its graphics processing units (GPUs), which were originally created to speed up graphics rendering in video games, have become the backbone of AI infrastructure given their superior processing speeds.As large tech companies and AI start-ups rush to improve their AI models, they need more and more computing power to train them, which is largely coming from GPUs. Through Nvidia\\'s CUDA X collection of libraries, tools, and microservices, its semiconductors are easily programmable for various AI tasks, which has allowed it to take a nearly 90% market share in the GPU space.Elon Musk\\'s xAI is a great example of the growing use of GPUs in AI model training. The company used 20,000 GPUs to train its Grok 2 model, while it originally was using 100,000 GPUs to train its Grok 3 model, but then increased it to 200,000 for phase two of its training. Meanwhile, Musk has talked about xAI\\'s data center hosting a 1 million GPU cluster in the future.Story continuesMeanwhile, Nvidia\\'s largest customer, Microsoft, announced it will spend $80 billion on AI data centers this year. Not to be outdone, a consortium consisting of Oracle, SoftBank Group, and OpenAI has discussed spending up to $500 billion on AI infrastructure in Texas as part of the recently announced Project Stargate.A lot of this spending will undoubtedly go toward GPUs. These projects demonstrate the type of growth still ahead for Nvidia.Image source: Getty Images.2. AlphabetWhile no mega-cap company can come close to matching Nvidia\\'s recent growth, Alphabet is a strong growing company that has the cheapest valuation among the Magnificent Seven with a forward P/E of only 19.4.Last quarter, Alphabet grew its revenue a solid 15%, while its profits soared 34% and its earnings per share climbed 37%. The growth was led by its cloud computing division, Google Cloud, which grew its revenue by 35%.Cloud computing is a business with very high fixed costs that has a lot of operating leverage once the business reaches scale. That was seen in its last quarter, when the segment saw a profitability inflection point, with segment operating income surging from $266 million a year ago to $1.95 billion.With organizations scampering to build out their own AI models and applications, expect this business to continue to grow strongly as Alphabet adds more data center capacity. Meanwhile, the company could see even more operating leverage as it has developed its own custom AI chips with the help of Broadcom, which it has said in combination with GPUs is helping reduce AI inference processing times and lowering costs.As it continues to scale up as the smallest of the big-three cloud computing companies and with its custom chip advantage, Google Cloud\\'s margins should continue to improve, leading to strong earnings growth.At the same time, Alphabet owns the world\\'s dominant search engine in Google and YouTube, the most viewed streaming platform globally. These businesses continue to grow revenue by double digits, with sales for its overall Google Services segment climbing 13% last quarter. Segment operating income soared 29% to $30.9 billion.The company is looking to incorporate its new Gemini AI model throughout its businesses this year to help drive growth, while also looking to promote its Gemini app, which is its answer to ChatGPT.Management also has other emerging businesses that it is investing in, including quantum computing, where it recently announced a big technological breakthrough. It also owns Waymo, which is currently the only company offering paid robotaxi rides in the U.S. These are presently money-losing business, but they have big potential.Overall, Alphabet is a nice combination of growth and value with some solid longer-term optionality with its investments in robotaxis and quantum computing.Don’t miss this second chance at a potentially lucrative opportunityEver feel like you missed the boat in buying the most successful stocks?

The answer was a shockingly low $3,625 at the time I crunched the numbers. Because Nvidia\\'s shares have risen over the last few days, the magic amount is even lower now.In my backward-looking exercise, I also examined what signs might have pointed to Nvidia\\'s potential for massive gains. And there were some good indications about the company\\'s prospects for anyone looking closely.But what about Nvidia\\'s prospects now? Where will the company and its stock be in 10 years? I won\\'t pretend to have any definitive answers. However, I\\'ll take a stab at where I think Nvidia will be in 2035.A prediction of Nvidia\\'s futureThe most important assumption I have about Nvidia\\'s future is that we\\'ve only seen the tip of the iceberg with how artificial intelligence (AI) will impact the world. I suspect more of the iceberg will be visible relatively soon, though, with the adoption of AI agents that can perform tasks autonomously.Could artificial general intelligence (AGI) be achieved within the next 10 years? Probably, depending on how you define AGI. I agree with Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang that AI models will be able to pass any test that humans can in five years or less. I wouldn\\'t go as far as predicting AI systems will be sentient (a criterion some have for AGI) by 2035, though.I fully expect Nvidia to remain a central player in AI over the next decade and beyond. The company\\'s new Blackwell GPU architecture -- which has the most powerful AI capabilities to date -- will likely seem painfully slow and unwieldy compared to what Nvidia will roll out 10 years from now.My future picture of Nvidia includes the company aggressively expanding into areas such as developing custom AI chips. I also think the autonomous ride-hailing market (robotaxis) will explode over the next few years, with Nvidia as one of the top beneficiaries.While AI is Nvidia\\'s biggest opportunity, in my opinion, I believe the company will also see tremendous growth thanks to the adoption of augmented reality (AR) and virtual reality (VR). AR and VR applications will require powerful graphics processors -- and no company is better at it than Nvidia.What could go wrong?Murphy\\'s Law can affect even the best companies. What could go wrong and derail my admittedly upbeat prediction about Nvidia\\'s future? Several things.Competition in the AI chip market will almost certainly increase significantly over the next 10 years. I expect Advanced Micro Devices will further step up its game. I\\'ll also keep my eyes on Nvidia\\'s big customers who have developed their own AI chips, including Google parent Alphabet, Amazon, and Microsoft.Story continuesPerhaps the most worrisome competition, though, could come from major technological breakthroughs by rivals. Nvidia\\'s Huang caused quantum computing stocks to plunge recently with his comments that practical quantum computers are probably 15 to 30 years away. That could be wishful thinking. I can envision a scenario where another company develops a quantum computer that\\'s more powerful for training and deploying AI models than Nvidia\\'s GPUs.As successful as it is (and I think will continue to be), Nvidia isn\\'t immune to macroeconomic factors. If the global economy enters into a deep, prolonged recession, the chipmaker might not grow nearly as much as I expect it will.I\\'d also be remiss without acknowledging that my optimism about the future of AI could be too pie in the sky. Maybe large language models (LLMs) could hit a performance plateau, with no better technologies emerging.The multitrillion-dollar questionSo far, I\\'ve only addressed where I think Nvidia\\'s business will be in 2035. But the multitrillion-dollar question is: Where will Nvidia stock be in 10 years?Before I attempt to answer this question, I\\'ll tell you what I don\\'t think will happen. Over the last 10 years, Nvidia\\'s share price has skyrocketed nearly 285 times higher. I don\\'t see the stock delivering anywhere near that kind of return over the next decade.However, as mentioned, I foresee major growth opportunities for Nvidia over the next 10 years in AI, robotaxis, and AR/VR. Could Nvidia\\'s compound annual growth rate (CAGR) be at least 15% during this period? I think it\\'s possible. If we assume a 15% CAGR, the stock would be a four-bagger by 2035, with a market cap of over $18 trillion.Admittedly, this prediction could be way too optimistic. But even if Nvidia delivers a much lower CAGR of 8%, its stock would more than double over the next decade and give the company a market cap of more than $11 trillion. Unless an unforeseen threat emerges that takes the wind out of Nvidia\\'s sails, the GPU maker\\'s future appears to be very bright.Don’t miss this second chance at a potentially lucrative opportunityEver feel like you missed the boat in buying the most successful stocks?

The semiconductor company is the leading seller of computer chips for artificial intelligence (AI) data centers, which are getting a huge boost in demand. Nvidia\\'s revenue and profits have soared in the last few years, with investors getting uber-bullish on the stock. As of this writing, Nvidia has a market cap of $3.46 trillion, making it the largest company in the world by market value.I think 2025 will be the year the Empire strikes back, with the rest of big tech regaining a negotiating foothold as semiconductor supply chains catch up with demand for AI products. Who will that benefit the most? My bet is Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN), the largest cloud computing company in the world, which is the backbone of many AI tools that are growing like gangbusters.Along with its dominant e-commerce operation, Amazon\\'s cloud computing division will allow it to finish 2025 with the largest market cap in the world. Here\\'s why.Steadily expanding profit marginsUnlike the rest of the big technology companies that already have sky-high profit margins, Amazon\\'s profitability is still vastly understated due to its propensity to invest for future growth. Last year, we started to see the company finally take its foot off the gas, a trend I think will continue in 2025.Over the last 12 months ending in September, Amazon posted an operating margin of 9.8%, a record high. Part of this is due to the Amazon Web Services (AWS) cloud computing segment, which had an operating margin of 35%. I expect AWS margins to remain strong, but the segment is still less than 20% of Amazon\\'s overall sales.Margin expansion is mainly coming from Amazon\\'s dominant North American e-commerce business, which posted an operating margin of 5.9% over the last 12 months. Still at a compressed level -- especially when you consider the tens of billions in high-margin third-party e-commerce fees, subscriptions, and advertising sales it brings in every year -- Amazon has plenty of room to bring segment profit margins even higher in 2025.While it won\\'t be an overnight story, Amazon can easily finish 2025 with a profit margin of 15% and most likely 20%, if it wants. The only question is how efficient its spending on research projects such as Alexa it will be.An artificial intelligence boom for the agesThere is a clear path to Amazon expanding its profit margins in 2025. There is also reason to believe it will keep accelerating revenue growth, especially at AWS.AWS\\'s net sales growth went from 12% in Q3 a year ago to 19% year-over-year growth last quarter. The boom in AI spending should continue in 2025, with capital expenditure budgets seemingly going up every day. This is a good thing for AWS, as more capital expenditures mean more demand for AI computing power, which means more revenue for AWS. In fact, famous investor Softbank announced it will be investing $100 billion in AI in the United States.\\xa0While all of this will not be spent on AWS data centers, the trend is here to stay.Story continuesIf AWS can grow its revenue by 30% over the next 12 months as more and more AI demand gets fulfilled, the division will reach $134 billion in sales and help accelerate Amazon\\'s consolidated revenue growth.NVDA Operating Income (TTM) data by YCharts.Why Amazon can finish 2025 as the largest company in the worldMy belief in Amazon finishing 2025 as the largest company in the world largely rests on an acceleration in revenue growth at AWS and consolidated profit margin expansion. Here\\'s the math that shows why this could occur.Amazon\\'s trailing 12-month revenue is $620 billion, with sales growing 11% year-over-year last quarter. If revenue growth can accelerate to 15% over the next 12 months, that will bring annual sales to $713 billion. It is a staggering size but shows the massive markets Amazon is going after in e-commerce, retail, and cloud computing.As I discussed above, there is room for Amazon to expand its operating margin to close to 20% in 2025. While I\\'m not confident it will hit exactly 20%, there should be high conviction in the general direction of this metric in 2025. If Amazon stopped investing in research projects, the company would likely have profit margins even higher than 20%.The 20% profit margins on $713 billion in revenue equals $142.6 billion in operating income. This is above the operating income generated by Nvidia, Apple, and Microsoft over the last 12 months. While not a guarantee, I think the company that generates the highest profit should have the largest market cap in the world, especially one with promising growth prospects such as Amazon. For this reason, I think Amazon will finish 2025 as the stock with the largest market cap in the world, making it a buy for your portfolio right now.Don’t miss this second chance at a potentially lucrative opportunityEver feel like you missed the boat in buying the most successful stocks?

Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) posted the biggest gain in the Dow Jones Industrial Average, and Palantir Technologies (NASDAQ: PLTR) delivered the top performance in the S&P 500. These players surged 171% and 340%, respectively.Why did investors pile into these stocks? Both have benefited from the artificial intelligence (AI) boom. Nvidia dominates the AI chip market, while Palantir uses AI as a key part of its software-as-a-service platform. As a result, revenue at both companies is soaring.After these successes, you may think it\\'s too late to get in on these top AI players. But we\\'re actually in the early days of the AI growth story, and these companies are well positioned to benefit through the next chapters. Let\\'s take a closer look at these two red-hot growth stocks that remain buys in 2025.Image source: Getty Images.1. NvidiaFirst, some background on this AI giant. Nvidia wasn\\'t always linked to AI. In its earlier days, it was known for its work with the video games industry. The company\\'s graphics processing units (GPUs) drove the lively images key to a great game (and they still do). But it soon became clear that GPUs could be useful in many other industries -- so Nvidia developed the CUDA parallel computing platform to make this a reality.Today, Nvidia serves various industries -- from healthcare to automobiles -- and its main focus is on AI. The data center business makes up the lion\\'s share of revenue, and it looks as if there\\'s a lot more growth to come. Here\\'s why. Nvidia will continue to benefit from the ongoing buildout of AI infrastructure, supplying GPUs and other products. For example, the U.S. just announced a new $500 billion AI infrastructure project and named Nvidia a key technology partner.On top of this, Nvidia is set to gain from the next wave of AI growth: applying AI to real-world situations. Agentic AI -- the use of AI agents to consider problems, reason, and apply solutions -- is a big part of that, and Nvidia has already taken steps here. The company offers blueprints for customers to design their own AI agents.So, today, trading for 49 times forward earnings estimates, Nvidia looks reasonably priced and makes a great growth buy for 2025 and beyond.2. Palantir TechnologiesTwenty-year-old Palantir was once known for its contracts with governments, its biggest customer group. But recently, a new growth driver has emerged: the commercial customer. Palantir sells software that aggregates a customer\\'s data and helps leverage that data to make often game-changing decisions.Story continuesThe company launched a new product, its Artificial Intelligence Platform (AIP), a little more than a year ago, and it\\'s helped this transition happen. AIP integrates AI into the data collection and decision-making processes. Palantir\\'s commercial customers,\\xa0totaling 14 just four years ago, have increased to about 300 -- concrete evidence that AIP is driving growth at Palantir.In even more good news, government revenue continues to increase, too, showing that the company now has two strong growth drivers. In the recent quarter, government and commercial revenue each climbed in the double digits, and Palantir reached its biggest profit ever.AIP is still a relatively new product, and the number of commercial customers today leaves plenty of room for growth. In addition, as mentioned, AI is still in its early stages of growth. Today\\'s $200 billion AI market may surpass $1 trillion by the end of the decade.And though Palantir looks expensive in relation to forward earnings estimates -- its forward price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio is 165 -- a metric that considers growth tells a different story. Palantir\\'s forward price/earnings-to-growth (PEG) ratio of 0.3 is reasonable, considering ratios of more than 1 suggest a stock is overvalued.\\xa0All of this means Palantir remains a solid buy for growth investors in 2025.Should you invest $1,000 in Nvidia right now?Before you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\\xa010 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Nvidia wasn’t one of them.

Is It a Buy?Alex Carchidi, The Motley FoolSun, Jan 26, 2025, 7:45 AM4 min readLink Copied0As you\\'ve probably heard by now, President Donald Trump recently launched the Official Trump meme coin with the ticker $TRUMP, which is hosted on the Solana (CRYPTO: SOL)blockchain. With a\\xa0 market cap of about $7 billion, the coin is already one of the most-valuable meme coins.There\\'s just been a new development which could send its price higher. Here\\'s what could happen, and how to think about it if you\\'re considering an investment.This asset may soon be available to a larger set of investorsIt\\'s often difficult to invest in the newest cryptocurrencies, even on relatively easy-to-use blockchains like Solana. Without going through the trouble of setting up a wallet, funding it with fiat money via an on-ramp, swapping that money for the blockchain\\'s native token, and then swapping the token for the actual investment you want to make, there\\'s no way to get exposure to most of the recently launched coins. Especially if you typically hold investments in a retirement account provided by a traditional financial institution, there are simply a lot of steps involved, and it\\'s a prohibitive barrier for the vast majority of people.Some major cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and Ethereum have such high investor demand that financial institutions have created workarounds. For example, exchange-traded funds (ETFs) that are meant to closely track the performance of these assets give investors the exposure they want via their normal financial accounts, such as an individual retirement account (IRA).ETFs tend to attract capital, buoying prices of the corresponding crypto and increasing their integration into traditional financial markets. So, the ETFs are seen as major catalysts, even if the actual evidence of this effect is somewhat ambiguous.In that vein, as of Jan. 21, there are now applications for an Official Trump ETF.Osprey Funds, the company that\\'s applied to sponsor the ETF, also filed for permission to offer ETFs for Solana, Dogecoin, and Bonk, so it\\'s safe to say that Trump\\'s coin isn\\'t alone in the meme coin ETF bonanza.Go for the safer option hereDoes the ETF filing make Official Trump a coin worth buying? Not exactly.First, there\\'s no guarantee regulators will approve the ETF. If it is, the effect on the price may not be what holders are hoping for. Consider that many investors have heard of the coin by now, and that most of the more highly motivated potential buyers have probably found a way to invest.Furthermore, there aren\\'t really any traditional financial fundamentals with which to model the asset\\'s appropriate value, making it very hard to understand whether investors would be getting a bargain by buying the coin now -- or paying way too much. An ETF won\\'t change that.Story continuesNor is it feasible to project the coin\\'s future growth in any sensible way. It\\'s true that the president has a vested financial interest in at least somewhat preserving the asset\\'s value, as it bears his name. But that doesn\\'t change the fact that as a meme coin, it\\'s inherently a highly speculative and volatile bet, regardless of whether it\\'s held on the blockchain directly or in an ETF.For most people, it simply isn\\'t a responsible financial decision to buy the Official Trump coin. Nonetheless, if you\\'re really enthusiastic about buying it regardless of the risks, it will be for the best if you ensure that your portfolio is already sufficiently diversified with safer investments beforehand.If your portfolio is already diversified, a smarter idea is to buy Solana and hold it for at least a few years if you want exposure to the effect of Trump\\'s coin or other meme coins on the cryptocurrency ecosystem.Anyone who wants to buy the president\\'s coin will need to buy Solana first to complete their purchase, which will create buying pressure and potentially continue to boost the price. At the same time, Solana itself is the main token of its chain, on which there\\'s currently a tremendous amount of activity. In other words, it doesn\\'t need any one project hosted on the chain to continue to gain in value for it to still be valuable.Should you invest $1,000 in Solana right now?Before you buy stock in Solana, consider this:The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\\xa010 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Solana wasn’t one of them.

It\\'s a lot. The entire week is really a blur — at least for journalists such as yours truly. Hundreds of conversations with people you\\'ve never met before. And hundreds more conversations with people you do know. There are breakfasts, lunches, and dinners where you meet hundreds more people. There is an insane amount of information, from public comments by top leaders to off-the-record shade being tossed to bodily clues on future earnings. I personally don\\'t gather my thoughts on what I learned until the week after WEF. But having just completed my sixth WEF, I\\'ve learned that by the end of the week, certain themes emerge. And I always do my best to bring you into this world. One theme again this year was the advancement in AI. Last year was the year of AI being created — this is the year leaders showed up to discuss the real impacts it\\'s having. \"Say goodbye to call centers,\" one industrial exec told me at an event. Noted economist Nouriel Roubini suggested we may have robot husbands/boyfriends and wives/girlfriends in the not-too-distant future.   Noted economist Nouriel Roubini (right) taping an episode of Yahoo Finance\\'s Opening Bid podcast at the Nasdaq house at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland. Roubini thinks the world isn\\'t too far away from having digital companions. · Yahoo Finance  I kept it moving on the Opening Bid podcast from the Nasdaq house on the promenade when he brought this up... Naturally, President Trump dominated WEF, from what people thought about his new meme coin (hedge fund investor Anthony Scaramucci told me it is basically garbage) to how tariffs will upend businesses (it may increase the cost of a shirt, Gap (GAP) CEO Richard Dickson and Ralph Lauren (RL) CEO Patrice Louvet told me). This year for my Davos recap, I thought I would serve up more of an evergreen guide to being a better investor or leader based on what I learned on the ground. Just some quick nuggets of wisdom, if you will.    Catch up on what you missed from our Davos coverage on our new hub. Don\\'t compromise your values as a leader: Clearly, Meta (META) founder Mark Zuckerberg sold out (he isn\\'t alone in Big Tech...). Zuck has chosen his own wealth and that of his shareholders by rolling back DEI initiatives to curry favor with President Trump. Some will say that\\'s just smart business, others will say it\\'s wrong. I liked what Nasdaq Inc. (NDAQ) CEO Adena Friedman — who has been championing boardroom diversity — told me on Opening Bid: \"I can say for Nasdaq, we\\'re very proud of what we do. We feel very good about the results that we\\'ve been able to achieve in terms of creating that culture of inclusivity and belonging. And I think a lot of companies feel the same way I do, and it\\'s just going to be a little bit quieter.\"  Story Continues    Don\\'t get left holding the bag: Talks about new meme coins from President Trump and Melania Trump dominated a lot of parties. So did concerns about current stock valuations. Skybridge Capital founder Anthony Scaramucci offered up a reminder to investors who tend to get sucked into the next hot asset or hold hot stocks for too long: \"Our society is always going to have gambling. Our society is always going to have smoking and alcohol.\" Investors could be left \"holding the bag\" on both coins amid volatile swings in value, \"The Mooch\" thinks.    Stay diversified, please: Billionaire investor and Bridgewater Associates founder Ray Dalio was full of investing wisdom when he showed up to an Opening Bid taping late in the evening. Dalio was game on, voicing concerns on US debt levels and stock valuations. I point-blank asked Dalio how someone could go about becoming a better investor. Here\\'s what he said: \"The most important thing is realizing that competing in the market, there\\'s alpha and there is beta. To get alpha, you have to take it away from somebody else, right? Beta means there\\'s an asset class. So first, be humble. Second, diversify well because you don\\'t pay a cost for the diversification, but you have to know how to risk-balance your investments to diversify. Also, get away from the notion that investments which have done well recently are better investments, rather than more expensive. You have to know the difference between an investment that has gone up a lot and one that has done well.\" On to Davos 2026! Brian Sozzi is Yahoo Finance\\'s Executive Editor.

Read More Trump is back. What’s next for crypto?   Photo: Bloomberg (Getty Images)   With Donald Trump set to be inaugurated as President of the United States on Monday, cryptocurrency stands as an unlikely part of his path back to power. The story of his return to the White House cannot be told without acknowledging how digital assets helped boost his political fortunes after his departure in 2021. Since his victory in November, Bitcoin rose from $75,000 to an all-time high of $108,135 on December 17, 2024, a 44% jump. Read More The Dow soars 450 points as Trump tones down his tariff tough talk   Photo: Melina Mara-Poo (Getty Images)   Stocks surged Tuesday afternoon, fueled at least in part by tempered expectations around the severity of President Donald Trump’s potential tariffs. The Dow Jones Industrial Average soared 448 points, or about 1%, the S&P 500 index climbed about 0.8%, and the Nasdaq index ticked up 0.65%. While Trump signed a swath of executive orders on his first day in office, ranging from return-to-office mandates for federal workers to moving to end birthright citizenship, his tariff talk was much softer than analysts had expected.

Is It a Buy?Alex Carchidi, The Motley FoolSun, Jan 26, 2025, 7:45 AM4 min readLink Copied0As you\\'ve probably heard by now, President Donald Trump recently launched the Official Trump meme coin with the ticker $TRUMP, which is hosted on the Solana (CRYPTO: SOL)blockchain. With a\\xa0 market cap of about $7 billion, the coin is already one of the most-valuable meme coins.There\\'s just been a new development which could send its price higher. Here\\'s what could happen, and how to think about it if you\\'re considering an investment.This asset may soon be available to a larger set of investorsIt\\'s often difficult to invest in the newest cryptocurrencies, even on relatively easy-to-use blockchains like Solana. Without going through the trouble of setting up a wallet, funding it with fiat money via an on-ramp, swapping that money for the blockchain\\'s native token, and then swapping the token for the actual investment you want to make, there\\'s no way to get exposure to most of the recently launched coins. Especially if you typically hold investments in a retirement account provided by a traditional financial institution, there are simply a lot of steps involved, and it\\'s a prohibitive barrier for the vast majority of people.Some major cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and Ethereum have such high investor demand that financial institutions have created workarounds. For example, exchange-traded funds (ETFs) that are meant to closely track the performance of these assets give investors the exposure they want via their normal financial accounts, such as an individual retirement account (IRA).ETFs tend to attract capital, buoying prices of the corresponding crypto and increasing their integration into traditional financial markets. So, the ETFs are seen as major catalysts, even if the actual evidence of this effect is somewhat ambiguous.In that vein, as of Jan. 21, there are now applications for an Official Trump ETF.Osprey Funds, the company that\\'s applied to sponsor the ETF, also filed for permission to offer ETFs for Solana, Dogecoin, and Bonk, so it\\'s safe to say that Trump\\'s coin isn\\'t alone in the meme coin ETF bonanza.Go for the safer option hereDoes the ETF filing make Official Trump a coin worth buying? Not exactly.First, there\\'s no guarantee regulators will approve the ETF. If it is, the effect on the price may not be what holders are hoping for. Consider that many investors have heard of the coin by now, and that most of the more highly motivated potential buyers have probably found a way to invest.Furthermore, there aren\\'t really any traditional financial fundamentals with which to model the asset\\'s appropriate value, making it very hard to understand whether investors would be getting a bargain by buying the coin now -- or paying way too much. An ETF won\\'t change that.Story continuesNor is it feasible to project the coin\\'s future growth in any sensible way. It\\'s true that the president has a vested financial interest in at least somewhat preserving the asset\\'s value, as it bears his name. But that doesn\\'t change the fact that as a meme coin, it\\'s inherently a highly speculative and volatile bet, regardless of whether it\\'s held on the blockchain directly or in an ETF.For most people, it simply isn\\'t a responsible financial decision to buy the Official Trump coin. Nonetheless, if you\\'re really enthusiastic about buying it regardless of the risks, it will be for the best if you ensure that your portfolio is already sufficiently diversified with safer investments beforehand.If your portfolio is already diversified, a smarter idea is to buy Solana and hold it for at least a few years if you want exposure to the effect of Trump\\'s coin or other meme coins on the cryptocurrency ecosystem.Anyone who wants to buy the president\\'s coin will need to buy Solana first to complete their purchase, which will create buying pressure and potentially continue to boost the price. At the same time, Solana itself is the main token of its chain, on which there\\'s currently a tremendous amount of activity. In other words, it doesn\\'t need any one project hosted on the chain to continue to gain in value for it to still be valuable.Should you invest $1,000 in Solana right now?Before you buy stock in Solana, consider this:The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\\xa010 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Solana wasn’t one of them.

It\\'s a lot. The entire week is really a blur — at least for journalists such as yours truly. Hundreds of conversations with people you\\'ve never met before. And hundreds more conversations with people you do know. There are breakfasts, lunches, and dinners where you meet hundreds more people. There is an insane amount of information, from public comments by top leaders to off-the-record shade being tossed to bodily clues on future earnings. I personally don\\'t gather my thoughts on what I learned until the week after WEF. But having just completed my sixth WEF, I\\'ve learned that by the end of the week, certain themes emerge. And I always do my best to bring you into this world. One theme again this year was the advancement in AI. Last year was the year of AI being created — this is the year leaders showed up to discuss the real impacts it\\'s having. \"Say goodbye to call centers,\" one industrial exec told me at an event. Noted economist Nouriel Roubini suggested we may have robot husbands/boyfriends and wives/girlfriends in the not-too-distant future.   Noted economist Nouriel Roubini (right) taping an episode of Yahoo Finance\\'s Opening Bid podcast at the Nasdaq house at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland. Roubini thinks the world isn\\'t too far away from having digital companions. · Yahoo Finance  I kept it moving on the Opening Bid podcast from the Nasdaq house on the promenade when he brought this up... Naturally, President Trump dominated WEF, from what people thought about his new meme coin (hedge fund investor Anthony Scaramucci told me it is basically garbage) to how tariffs will upend businesses (it may increase the cost of a shirt, Gap (GAP) CEO Richard Dickson and Ralph Lauren (RL) CEO Patrice Louvet told me). This year for my Davos recap, I thought I would serve up more of an evergreen guide to being a better investor or leader based on what I learned on the ground. Just some quick nuggets of wisdom, if you will.    Catch up on what you missed from our Davos coverage on our new hub. Don\\'t compromise your values as a leader: Clearly, Meta (META) founder Mark Zuckerberg sold out (he isn\\'t alone in Big Tech...). Zuck has chosen his own wealth and that of his shareholders by rolling back DEI initiatives to curry favor with President Trump. Some will say that\\'s just smart business, others will say it\\'s wrong. I liked what Nasdaq Inc. (NDAQ) CEO Adena Friedman — who has been championing boardroom diversity — told me on Opening Bid: \"I can say for Nasdaq, we\\'re very proud of what we do. We feel very good about the results that we\\'ve been able to achieve in terms of creating that culture of inclusivity and belonging. And I think a lot of companies feel the same way I do, and it\\'s just going to be a little bit quieter.\"  Story Continues    Don\\'t get left holding the bag: Talks about new meme coins from President Trump and Melania Trump dominated a lot of parties. So did concerns about current stock valuations. Skybridge Capital founder Anthony Scaramucci offered up a reminder to investors who tend to get sucked into the next hot asset or hold hot stocks for too long: \"Our society is always going to have gambling. Our society is always going to have smoking and alcohol.\" Investors could be left \"holding the bag\" on both coins amid volatile swings in value, \"The Mooch\" thinks.    Stay diversified, please: Billionaire investor and Bridgewater Associates founder Ray Dalio was full of investing wisdom when he showed up to an Opening Bid taping late in the evening. Dalio was game on, voicing concerns on US debt levels and stock valuations. I point-blank asked Dalio how someone could go about becoming a better investor. Here\\'s what he said: \"The most important thing is realizing that competing in the market, there\\'s alpha and there is beta. To get alpha, you have to take it away from somebody else, right? Beta means there\\'s an asset class. So first, be humble. Second, diversify well because you don\\'t pay a cost for the diversification, but you have to know how to risk-balance your investments to diversify. Also, get away from the notion that investments which have done well recently are better investments, rather than more expensive. You have to know the difference between an investment that has gone up a lot and one that has done well.\" On to Davos 2026! Brian Sozzi is Yahoo Finance\\'s Executive Editor.

Silicon Valley leaders in attendance included Mark Zuckerberg, Jeff Bezos, and Elon Musk, who addressed the crowd.💰💸 Don’t miss the move: SIGN UP for TheStreet’s FREE Daily newsletter 💰💸While many influential figures from the industry have chosen to embrace Trump, visiting his Mar-a-Lago estate and making donations to his inaugural fund, one of the sector’s most unspoken voices has maintained his anti-Trump stance.Mark Cuban threw his weight behind Kamala Harris and has publicly criticized Trump many times despite initially supporting him in 2016.Related: Mark Cuban’s net worth: \\'Shark Tank\\' investments, Dallas Mavericks & moreCuban is also known for being a vocal crypto supporter, praising meme coins such as Dogecoin\\xa0 (~DOGEUSD)  and Shiba Inu\\xa0 (~SHIBUSD) . Recently, though, he shared his scathing take on a crypto that has been surging in popularity since Trump’s reelection, making a dire prediction for anyone who has invested in it.Mark Cuban recently issued a dire warning for crypto investors, cautioning them to be careful with Donald Trump\\'s new meme coin (Photo by Jon Kopaloff/Getty Images for WIRED)Jon Kopaloff/Getty ImagesCuban predicts dark days ahead for Trump crypto holdersKnown for his years as a judge on Shark Tank, Cuban has gained popularity in recent years for his pro-crypto stances. He has expressed support for digital assets ranging from Bitcoin\\xa0 (~BTCUSD) \\xa0and Ethereum\\xa0 (~ETHUSD) \\xa0to Dogecoin, created initially as a joke.But Cuban doesn’t think there’s anything funny about a certain crypto that has been trending lately. Specifically, a meme coin whose value literally rises and falls with the popularity of a certain internet fad.Related: Billionaires battle for the future of social mediaIn this case, the trend in question is Trump. Since its launch a few days ago, the OFFICIAL $TRUMP crypto token has surged more than 500%. Trump posted about it on his X account, promoting the crypto.This quickly prompted ethical concerns from experts who saw it as a potential conflict of interest from an incoming U.S. president. However, Cuban has outlined other concerns and examined them from a financial perspective.In a post on X, he responded to a post praising the Trump meme coin, implying that he thinks it will prevent the crypto industry from gaining legitimacy and could lead to further scams targeting people with a limited understanding of the technology.Mint it, Print it, Sell it Fuck it. That is the mantra for the world you are suggesting. This is the biggest bunch of self serving Bullshit I have ever heard. In your world there is no ownership. Just speculation. Hello every scam targeted at everyone and anyone who has… https://t.co/OgA1kE9aAX— Mark Cuban (@mcuban) January 20, 2025In a separate post on Bluesky, he laid out the problems he sees with TRUMP crypto, drawing a subtle comparison between Trump and ponzi scheme enactor Bernie Madoff.Story continues“It’s just a matter of time until a lot of people lose money from this,” he stated, discussing the new TRUMP memecoin. “I’m a crypto fan. This is not crypto any more than Madoff was just buying and selling shares of stock.”Cuban didn’t provide any further context regarding why he feels TRUMP isn’t a safe investment. But as some crypto purists have argued that meme coins should not be considered actual crypto, due to their lack of real world utility, that may be part of his thought process.TikTok doesn\\'t hesitate to shut down trending Elon Musk rumorsInternal messages from Meta leaders reveal fierce AI rivalryNvidia makes a major change as it prepares to enter a hot new marketWithin a few hours of its launch, TRUMP crypto had raised almost $5.5 billion. While it is still unclear exactly how much Donald Trump himself will profit from the meme coin’s success, BBC reports that CIC Digital LLC, the Trump Organization affiliate that helped with the launch, owns 80% of the crypto’s tokens.Is it smart to invest in Trump?During the election, Trump vowed to usher in a new era of crypto regulation, a dramatic shift from his previous position that included calling Bitcoin a “scam against the dollar.” This stance generated a lot of positive momentum for crypto markets but that doesn’t mean all coins and tokens will benefit in the same way.Related: TikTok ban could be a major catalyst for rivalMeme coins are often written off as unstable investments due to their highly volatile nature and lack of any actual value, either economic or intrinsic. This can make them enticing for risk-savvy traders who enjoy that type of investing, but historically, being closely linked to Trump hasn’t been good for long term value growth.Trump Media & Technology Group\\xa0 (DJT) , the parent company of Truth Social, is falling today, despite Trump recently returning to the White House. And the price of TRUMP crypto is falling as well, which may be seen as an indication that Cuban’s bearish thesis is correct.Other experts have expressed similar takes on $TRUMP crypto. WIRED reports that “As the Trump organizations enrich themselves through the sale of tokens, other investors—at least some of whom are presumably diehard Trump supporters—may therefore suffer a fall in the value of their coins.”The outlet also notes that the upcoming release of more tokens is likely to put downward pressure on current tokens, as it would ramp up supply without a clear increase in demand.Related: Veteran fund manager issues dire S&P 500 warning for 2025View commentsAdvertisement     Copyright © 2025 Yahoo.

Silicon Valley leaders in attendance included Mark Zuckerberg, Jeff Bezos, and Elon Musk, who addressed the crowd.💰💸 Don’t miss the move: SIGN UP for TheStreet’s FREE Daily newsletter 💰💸While many influential figures from the industry have chosen to embrace Trump, visiting his Mar-a-Lago estate and making donations to his inaugural fund, one of the sector’s most unspoken voices has maintained his anti-Trump stance.Mark Cuban threw his weight behind Kamala Harris and has publicly criticized Trump many times despite initially supporting him in 2016.Related: Mark Cuban’s net worth: \\'Shark Tank\\' investments, Dallas Mavericks & moreCuban is also known for being a vocal crypto supporter, praising meme coins such as Dogecoin\\xa0 (~DOGEUSD)  and Shiba Inu\\xa0 (~SHIBUSD) . Recently, though, he shared his scathing take on a crypto that has been surging in popularity since Trump’s reelection, making a dire prediction for anyone who has invested in it.Mark Cuban recently issued a dire warning for crypto investors, cautioning them to be careful with Donald Trump\\'s new meme coin (Photo by Jon Kopaloff/Getty Images for WIRED)Jon Kopaloff/Getty ImagesCuban predicts dark days ahead for Trump crypto holdersKnown for his years as a judge on Shark Tank, Cuban has gained popularity in recent years for his pro-crypto stances. He has expressed support for digital assets ranging from Bitcoin\\xa0 (~BTCUSD) \\xa0and Ethereum\\xa0 (~ETHUSD) \\xa0to Dogecoin, created initially as a joke.But Cuban doesn’t think there’s anything funny about a certain crypto that has been trending lately. Specifically, a meme coin whose value literally rises and falls with the popularity of a certain internet fad.Related: Billionaires battle for the future of social mediaIn this case, the trend in question is Trump. Since its launch a few days ago, the OFFICIAL $TRUMP crypto token has surged more than 500%. Trump posted about it on his X account, promoting the crypto.This quickly prompted ethical concerns from experts who saw it as a potential conflict of interest from an incoming U.S. president. However, Cuban has outlined other concerns and examined them from a financial perspective.In a post on X, he responded to a post praising the Trump meme coin, implying that he thinks it will prevent the crypto industry from gaining legitimacy and could lead to further scams targeting people with a limited understanding of the technology.Mint it, Print it, Sell it Fuck it. That is the mantra for the world you are suggesting. This is the biggest bunch of self serving Bullshit I have ever heard. In your world there is no ownership. Just speculation. Hello every scam targeted at everyone and anyone who has… https://t.co/OgA1kE9aAX— Mark Cuban (@mcuban) January 20, 2025In a separate post on Bluesky, he laid out the problems he sees with TRUMP crypto, drawing a subtle comparison between Trump and ponzi scheme enactor Bernie Madoff.Story continues“It’s just a matter of time until a lot of people lose money from this,” he stated, discussing the new TRUMP memecoin. “I’m a crypto fan. This is not crypto any more than Madoff was just buying and selling shares of stock.”Cuban didn’t provide any further context regarding why he feels TRUMP isn’t a safe investment. But as some crypto purists have argued that meme coins should not be considered actual crypto, due to their lack of real world utility, that may be part of his thought process.TikTok doesn\\'t hesitate to shut down trending Elon Musk rumorsInternal messages from Meta leaders reveal fierce AI rivalryNvidia makes a major change as it prepares to enter a hot new marketWithin a few hours of its launch, TRUMP crypto had raised almost $5.5 billion. While it is still unclear exactly how much Donald Trump himself will profit from the meme coin’s success, BBC reports that CIC Digital LLC, the Trump Organization affiliate that helped with the launch, owns 80% of the crypto’s tokens.Is it smart to invest in Trump?During the election, Trump vowed to usher in a new era of crypto regulation, a dramatic shift from his previous position that included calling Bitcoin a “scam against the dollar.” This stance generated a lot of positive momentum for crypto markets but that doesn’t mean all coins and tokens will benefit in the same way.Related: TikTok ban could be a major catalyst for rivalMeme coins are often written off as unstable investments due to their highly volatile nature and lack of any actual value, either economic or intrinsic. This can make them enticing for risk-savvy traders who enjoy that type of investing, but historically, being closely linked to Trump hasn’t been good for long term value growth.Trump Media & Technology Group\\xa0 (DJT) , the parent company of Truth Social, is falling today, despite Trump recently returning to the White House. And the price of TRUMP crypto is falling as well, which may be seen as an indication that Cuban’s bearish thesis is correct.Other experts have expressed similar takes on $TRUMP crypto. WIRED reports that “As the Trump organizations enrich themselves through the sale of tokens, other investors—at least some of whom are presumably diehard Trump supporters—may therefore suffer a fall in the value of their coins.”The outlet also notes that the upcoming release of more tokens is likely to put downward pressure on current tokens, as it would ramp up supply without a clear increase in demand.Related: Veteran fund manager issues dire S&P 500 warning for 2025View commentsAdvertisement     Copyright © 2025 Yahoo.
