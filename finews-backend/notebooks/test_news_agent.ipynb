Shares have lost over 12% this week after the emergence of a sophisticated, lower-cost AI model from Chinese startup DeepSeek spurred a reckoning\\xa0on Wall Street about AI spending.  Analysts have largely remained bullish on the chipmaker\\'s stock, suggesting the market\\'s reaction may have been overblown.       Nvidia (NVDA) CEO Jensen Huang is set to meet with President Donald Trump at the White House, Bloomberg reported Friday, after a wild week for the chipmaker\\'s stock. Shares wavered between gains and losses near $125 in afternoon trading Friday, having lost more than 12% of their value this week after the rapid rise of Chinese AI startup DeepSeek rattled markets. The surging popularity of an app from DeepSeek, which claimed it developed an AI model rivaling the performance of American competitors for a fraction of the cost, spurred a reckoning on Wall Street about the competitiveness of American AI leaders and their spending on tech, sending shares of Nvidia and other AI stocks into a tailspin earlier in the week. Still, analysts have largely remained bullish on the chipmaker\\'s stock, with Bank of America telling clients Wednesday they \"view the recent selloff as an enhanced buy opportunity.\" Analysts at Bernstein, Citi, Wedbush, Raymond James, and elsewhere were also among those that suggested the market’s reaction may have been overblown.    Raymond James and Bank of America added that they expect competition from China could push Big Tech companies like Microsoft (MSFT), Amazon (AMZN), and Alphabet (GOOGL) to spend even more on AI, to the benefit of Nvidia, Broadcom (AVGO), and other AI chipmakers. In earnings calls this week, executives from Microsoft and Meta stood by their plans to spend billions of dollars this year on AI infrastructure. Huang\\'s meeting at the White House also comes following reports the Trump administration could be considering further tightening restrictions on sales of advanced U.S. chips to China. Nvidia reported in November that sales to China accounted for more than 15% of the chipmaker\\'s revenues in its fiscal third quarter. Nvidia is set to report its fourth-quarter results on Feb. 26.

Chief Executive Officer Jensen Huang at the White House as the US prepares tariffs on semiconductors, weighs the fate of a chip subsidy program and probes whether Chinese AI startup DeepSeek skirted export controls to obtain the company’s products.    Most Read from Bloomberg  How the 2025 Catholic Jubilee Is Reshaping Rome  Trump Paves the Way to Deputize Local Police on Immigration  Manhattan’s Morning Commute Time Drops With New Congestion Toll  Historic London Elevator Faces Last Stop in Labour’s Housing Push  Housing Aid Uncertain After Trump’s Spending Freeze Memo   Chip tariffs would weigh heavily on Nvidia, which relies on overseas partners to manufacture its semiconductors. Trump told reporters he’d had a good meeting with Huang, but insisted “eventually we’re going to put tariffs on chips.” In response to a question about the potential for more restrictions on chip exports to China, the president said he will move forward with tariffs. Current limitations on shipping to China take the form of license requirements administered by the Department of Commerce. An Nvidia spokesperson said Huang “appreciated the opportunity to meet with President Trump and discuss semiconductors and AI policy.” The two talked about “the importance of strengthening US technology and AI leadership,” the spokesperson said.    The meeting came at the end of a rocky week for Nvidia, the top maker of chips to power artificial intelligence workloads. DeepSeek released its R1 model, which is seen as competitive with chatbots from other companies at a fraction of the cost. That raised questions about the billions in planned spending to develop AI technology and whether Beijing has closed the gap with the US in the sphere. The ensuing market reaction was particularly stark for Nvidia, with shares of the company plunging Monday in one of the biggest selloffs in history. Investors are concerned that DeepSeek’s method for developing effective AI software doesn’t require as much of the expensive gear that Nvidia sells. Nvidia shares declined 3.7% to $120.07 at the close Friday, bringing the stock’s cumulative slide to 16% this week. Trump administration officials have begun probing whether DeepSeek purchased banned Nvidia chips through intermediaries in Singapore, circumventing US restrictions on the sales of processors used for AI tasks, according to people familiar with the matter. Huang’s meeting with Trump has been in the works for several weeks, according to a person familiar with the matter. The goal was to discuss AI policy, and it wasn’t prompted by the DeepSeek breakthrough, said the person, who described the plans on condition of anonymity.  Story Continues    The Nvidia CEO had floated meeting with Trump earlier this month, when he signaled hope for a lighter regulatory touch from the new administration. Unlike other tech leaders, including Meta Platforms Inc. CEO Mark Zuckerberg and Amazon.com Inc. co-founder Jeff Bezos, Huang skipped Trump’s inauguration in Washington and instead traveled to Asia on a long-planned trip around the Lunar New Year. The plans for the Trump and Huang meeting were reported earlier by Gray Television News. Friday’s sit-down was the first meeting between the pair. Nvidia is central to the AI boom, and its chips have assumed geopolitical significance in the intensifying race between the US and China over artificial intelligence.    The company has lobbied furiously in recent weeks against sweeping controls on the global sales of its processors, and Huang has expressed optimism about the possibility of easing regulatory burdens under Trump’s administration. It will take months for Trump to fully staff the teams responsible for those policies, but there are early indications that his administration will take a tough approach on sales of US technology to China. Some Trump officials are interested in curbing exports of less-advanced chips that Nvidia sells. Howard Lutnick, Trump’s pick for Commerce secretary, during his confirmation hearing on Wednesday suggested that DeepSeek had evaded US export controls and pledged a “very strong” response. If confirmed, Lutnick would be in charge of the Bureau of Industry and Security, which is responsible for writing and enforcing sweeping controls on sales of chips and related manufacturing equipment to China. Trump last week unveiled a $100 billion artificial intelligence infrastructure investment — with goals of $500 billion down the road — from OpenAI, SoftBank Group Corp. and Oracle Corp.    Trump has said new “AI solutions” from the US would be introduced in the near future. On Thursday, OpenAI CEO Sam Altman teased new advances in the company’s products in a closed-door meeting in Washington attended by officials from Congress and the White House. He used the gathering to urge US policymakers to invest heavily in physical infrastructure to support artificial intelligence development. --With assistance from Caroline Hyde, Romy Varghese and Ian King.

Liang, 40, on Tuesday returned to Mililing village in Zhanjiang, a port city in southern Guangdong province, where a red banner was raised hailing the low-profile tech entrepreneur as \"hometown pride\" for bringing honour to the local community, according to social-media posts. His visit on Lunar New Year\\'s Eve marks the day when Chinese families traditionally hold reunions during this national public holiday. It also raised the profile of Liang\\'s hometown, which has turned into a tourist attraction based on its DeepSeek connection, amid an influx of domestic visitors to the remote village, according to a report by Yangcheng Evening News, a state-backed publication based in Guangzhou, capital of Guangdong.

Hangzhou-based DeepSeek sent shock waves through Wall Street and Silicon Valley for developing AI models at a fraction of the cost and computing power that US tech firms like OpenAI, Google and Meta Platforms typically invest in such projects.

Photo: Weibo alt=A red banner hung on a wall hails \"hometown pride\" Liang Wenfeng, founder and chief executive of DeepSeek, for bringing honour to Mililing village in Zhanjiang, a port city in southern Guangdong province. Photo: Weibo> The heightened domestic and international attention given to DeepSeek and its founder reflects the AI community\\'s admiration for the firm\\'s low-cost development of world-class models - which either surpassed or matched the performance of rival products across a range of industry benchmark tests - in spite of tightened US restrictions on China\\'s access to advanced semiconductors and related technologies. An unidentified fellow Mililing villager was quoted by Yangcheng Evening News as saying that Liang was gifted growing up there, adding that \"he taught himself senior high-school maths when he was still a junior\".  Story Continues    During the 2002-2010 period when he studied in Zhejiang University, Liang developed an interest in applying machine-learning technology to quantitative trading. In 2015, Liang founded High-Flyer Quant, which uses deep-learning algorithms to run what has become one of the largest quantitative hedge funds in mainland China. In 2023, the company spun off DeepSeek as an independent enterprise. There are certain similarities between Liang and Jim Simons, the American quantitative hedge fund manager and mathematician, according to journalist Gregory Zuckerman, who wrote a book about the US billionaire titled The Man Who Solved the Market.    Liang apparently draws inspiration from Simons and agreed to write the preface of the book\\'s Chinese edition, Zuckerman reported in The Wall Street Journal. \"The publication of this book unravels many previously unresolved mysteries and brings us a wealth of experiences to learn from,\" Liang wrote in the preface. Liang also pointed out that whenever he encounters difficulties at work, he recalls Simons\\' words: \"There must be a way to model prices.\" This article originally appeared in the South China Morning Post (SCMP), the most authoritative voice reporting on China and Asia for more than a century.

Dan Victor, The Motley Fool   Sat, Feb 1, 2025, 4:12 AM 5 min read                   In This Article:    NVDA       DeepSeek, a Chinese artificial intelligence (AI) start-up, is sending shock waves through the U.S. tech sector by demonstrating its latest AI assistant, which achieves performance comparable to or even surpassing some of the world\\'s best chatbots. The kicker here is that DeepSeek reportedly accomplished this using significantly less computational power, relying on fewer and less advanced AI chips -- particularly Nvidia\\'s (NASDAQ: NVDA) cutting-edge GPUs, which are typically considered essential for such tasks.    This development suggests a potentially disruptive method for developing large language models (LLMs), offering a more efficient alternative to current strategies. It raises questions about future infrastructure investments and the demand for AI chips. The market\\'s reaction has been swift: As of this wriging, Nvidia\\'s stock has plunged more than 22% from its recent peak, with similar declines in other leading AI tech stocks. Let\\'s explore what DeepSeek\\'s emergence could mean for Nvidia and how it might affect investors\\' portfolios. The innovation behind DeepSeek\\'s success Artificial intelligence is not only a major theme in technology but also a national security issue, given its pivotal role in areas like data analysis, intelligence, and military applications. This has led the United States to impose bans or severe restrictions on exporting high-end technologies, such as specialized AI semiconductors, to China since 2023, aiming to slow the country\\'s technological progress and safeguard crucial supply chains. Despite these constraints, DeepSeek managed to develop AI models like DeepSeek-V3 and DeepSeek-R1 with cutting-edge capabilities on a reported training budget of around $6 million. Its white paper outlines an innovative approach that combines software ingenuity with new training techniques to maximize the potential of older Nvidia GPUs, surpassing their initial capabilities.    DeepSeek\\'s models have shown impressive results next to market-leading alternatives from OpenAI, Alphabet, and Meta Platforms in benchmarks for problem-solving, mathematical reasoning, coding, and general knowledge. The DeepSeek AI Assistant rapidly ascended to become the most-downloaded free application on the Apple App Store in the United States, demonstrating significant market traction and consumer acceptance. DeepSeek\\'s disruptive influence is further underscored by its open-source platform, which makes the code publicly accessible, allowing businesses and developers to customize AI models without incurring the high costs of proprietary systems. For those seeking to integrate DeepSeek\\'s most advanced models into existing tech infrastructure via an application programming interface (api), the company reportedly offers commercial pricing that is significantly lower than that of its competitors.  Story Continues      Image source: Getty Images.   Implications for Nvidia DeepSeek\\'s emergence has multiple implications for the broader tech sector. Given the initial sell-off, the market has interpreted this development as decisively negative, likely based on a concern that novel AI development methods could reduce the demand for cutting-edge, expensive hardware and cut into the competitive moat of established leaders. That being said, the impact on Nvidia may be more nuanced as it looks like the next-generation AI chips, including Nvidia\\'s Blackwell GPU architecture, are essential for pushing the boundaries of high-performance computing.    If DeepSeek managed to break AI performance benchmarks with legacy hardware, its methods toward computational efficiency implemented by other tech players could make Nvidia\\'s high-end products incrementally even more powerful. This scenario could help expand the AI market by opening up new uses that may become cost-effective while accelerating the timetable toward future breakthroughs like artificial general intelligence (AGI) applications as a demand driver for Nvidia. On the other hand, it is also clear that DeepSeek has introduced a new layer of complexity regarding Nvidia\\'s growth runway. According to Wall Street analysts monitored by Yahoo! Finance, the chipmaker is expected to reach $197 billion in revenue in fiscal 2026, which ends in January 2026, driving a 51% increase in earnings per share (EPS) to $4.45. Any sign that customers are pivoting away from large orders, even at the margin, would undermine this earnings outlook and further pressure the stock. The company\\'s upcoming fiscal 2025 fourth-quarter and full-year earnings report, set to be released on Feb. 26, will provide Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang and hist eam a chance to address whether DeepSeek is affecting the business and reassure shareholders.  Metric  FY 2025 Analyst Estimate  FY 2026 Analyst Estimate   Revenue  $129.2 billion  $196.5 billion   Revenue growth (YOY)  112%  52%   EPS  $2.95  $4.45   EPS growth (YOY)  127%  51%    Data source: Yahoo! Finance. FY = fiscal year. YOY = year over year. The big picture for investors DeepSeek appears to have signaled a new shift toward efficiency in AI software, highlighting the rapidly changing landscape. Recognizing near-term uncertainties with an expectation for volatility to continue, I believe investors should stay the course with Nvidia as an AI leader with a technological edge in hardware. Unless there is evidence that its financials are under pressure, a positive long-term outlook should support the stock, which remains well positioned to rebound.

Chinese AI lab DeepSeek broke into the mainstream consciousness this week after its chatbot app rose to the top of the Apple App Store charts (and Google Play, as well). DeepSeek’s AI models, which were trained using compute-efficient techniques, have led Wall Street analysts — and technologists — to question whether the U.S. can maintain its lead in the AI race and whether the demand for AI chips will sustain. But where did DeepSeek come from, and how did it rise to international fame so quickly? DeepSeek\\'s trader origins DeepSeek is backed by High-Flyer Capital Management, a Chinese quantitative hedge fund that uses AI to inform its trading decisions. AI enthusiast Liang Wenfeng co-founded High-Flyer in 2015. Wenfeng, who reportedly began dabbling in trading while a student at Zhejiang University, launched High-Flyer Capital Management as a hedge fund in 2019 focused on developing and deploying AI algorithms.    In 2023, High-Flyer started DeepSeek as a lab dedicated to researching AI tools separate from its financial business. With High-Flyer as one of its investors, the lab spun off into its own company, also called DeepSeek. From day one, DeepSeek built its own data center clusters for model training. But like other AI companies in China, DeepSeek has been affected by U.S. export bans on hardware. To train one of its more recent models, the company was forced to use Nvidia H800 chips, a less-powerful version of a chip, the H100, available to U.S. companies. DeepSeek\\'s technical team is said to skew young. The company reportedly aggressively recruits doctorate AI researchers from top Chinese universities. DeepSeek also hires people without any computer science background to help its tech better understand a wide range of subjects, per The New York Times. DeepSeek\\'s strong models DeepSeek unveiled its first set of models — DeepSeek Coder, DeepSeek LLM, and DeepSeek Chat — in November 2023. But it wasn\\'t until last spring, when the startup released its next-gen DeepSeek-V2 family of models, that the AI industry started to take notice. DeepSeek-V2, a general-purpose text- and image-analyzing system, performed well in various AI benchmarks — and was far cheaper to run than comparable models at the time. It forced DeepSeek\\'s domestic competition, including ByteDance and Alibaba, to cut the usage prices for some of their models, and make others completely free.    DeepSeek-V3, launched in December 2024, only added to DeepSeek\\'s notoriety. According to DeepSeek’s internal benchmark testing, DeepSeek V3 outperforms both downloadable, openly available models like Meta’s\\xa0Llama and “closed” models that can only be accessed through an API, like OpenAI\\'s GPT-4o.  Story Continues    Equally impressive is DeepSeek\\'s R1 \"reasoning\" model. Released in January, DeepSeek claims R1 performs as well as OpenAI’s\\xa0o1\\xa0model on key benchmarks. Being a reasoning model, R1 effectively fact-checks itself, which\\xa0helps it to avoid some of the\\xa0pitfalls\\xa0that normally trip up models. Reasoning models take a little longer — usually seconds to minutes longer — to arrive at solutions compared to a typical non-reasoning model. The upside is that they tend to be more reliable in domains such as physics, science, and math.    There is a downside to R1, DeepSeek V3, and DeepSeek\\'s other models, however. Being Chinese-developed AI, they\\'re subject to\\xa0benchmarking\\xa0by China’s internet regulator to ensure that its responses \"embody core socialist values.\" In DeepSeek\\'s chatbot app, for example, R1 won’t answer questions about Tiananmen Square or Taiwan’s autonomy. A disruptive approach If DeepSeek has a business model, it\\'s not clear what that model is, exactly. The company prices its products and services well below market value — and gives others away for free. The way DeepSeek tells it, efficiency breakthroughs have enabled it to maintain extreme cost competitiveness. Some experts dispute the figures the company has supplied, however. Whatever the case may be, developers have taken to DeepSeek\\'s models, which aren\\'t open source as the phrase is commonly understood but are available under permissive licenses that allow for commercial use. According to Clem Delangue, the CEO of Hugging Face, one of the platforms hosting DeepSeek\\'s models, developers on Hugging Face have created over 500 “derivative” models of R1 that have racked up 2.5 million downloads combined.    DeepSeek\\'s success against larger and more established rivals has been described as \"upending AI\" and \"over-hyped.\" The company\\'s success was at least in part responsible for causing Nvidia\\'s stock price to drop by 18% on Monday, and for eliciting a public response from OpenAI CEO Sam Altman. Microsoft announced that DeepSeek is available on its Azure AI Foundry service, Microsoft\\'s platform that brings together AI services for enterprises under a single banner. When asked about DeepSeek\\'s impact on Meta\\'s AI spending during its first-quarter earnings call, CEO Mark Zuckerberg said spending on AI infrastructure will continue to be a “strategic advantage” for Meta. As for what DeepSeek\\'s future might hold, it\\'s not clear. Improved models are a given. But the U.S. government appears to be growing wary of what it perceives as harmful foreign influence.

Most Read from Bloomberg  How the 2025 Catholic Jubilee Is Reshaping Rome  Trump Paves the Way to Deputize Local Police on Immigration  Manhattan’s Morning Commute Time Drops With New Congestion Toll  Historic London Elevator Faces Last Stop in Labour’s Housing Push  Housing Aid Uncertain After Trump’s Spending Freeze Memo      Of the 260 respondents, 88% said the debut of the startup’s latest model — which wiped $784 billion from the S&P 500 on Monday — will have little to no impact on the shares of the US technology behemoths in coming weeks. Few are cutting their exposure to the S&P 500, an index dominated by the massive tech companies. Instead, it will be President Donald Trump’s policies that drive equity volatility this year, according to 59% of participants in a survey conducted from Jan. 28-30. With the S&P 500’s leadership more concentrated than it has been in over 20 years, investors and strategists have frequently warned that volatility in the handful of megacap names that have pulled indexes higher could hurt broader markets. Monday’s selloff had its share of eye-watering moves, including AI darling Nvidia Corp’s $589 billion drop in market value, the biggest single-day loss of value for any public company in history. Yet beyond tech stocks, the impact on the broader market was largely contained. The S&P 500’s decline of 1.5% on that day was only the index’s biggest loss in 10 sessions. The benchmark index rose 0.5% on Thursday, paring earlier gains after Trump said he would follow through on threats to impose 25% tariffs on Canada and Mexico on Feb. 1. It has made up most of the ground lost in Monday’s drop.    Disruptors Disrupted Dethroning the Magnificent Seven won’t be easy, as the companies have been able to build significant competitive moats around their businesses, said Steve Sosnick, chief strategist at Interactive Brokers LLC. Still, Monday’s selloff reminds Wall Street that “even disruptors are at risk of being disrupted,” he says. “If companies are earning outsized profits, it is inevitable that competitors will arise in hopes of reaping some of those gains.” Major tech firms reporting earnings this week remain bullish on their competitiveness in the AI race. Meta Platforms Inc. Chief Executive Officer Mark Zuckerberg said 2025 will be a “really big year” for his company’s AI strategy. His comments came after the company unveiled higher-than-estimated capital expenditure last week, raising concerns it would struggle to monetize its AI investments.  Story Continues    Meanwhile, Microsoft Corp. said its cloud-computing business will continue to grow slowly in the current quarter as the behemoth struggles to build enough data centers to meet demand for its AI products. Nvidia Corp. is scheduled to report results on February 26. Overblown Reaction When asked how DeepSeek’s emergence would affect their investments, 63% of survey participants said they have no plans to change their exposure to the S&P 500. More than half said this week’s rout was overblown, given questions over how DeepSeek managed to release an AI model that it claims cost a fraction of what US industry leaders spent on theirs.    With respondents seeing the Trump administration as a bigger catalyst than AI for stock performance this year, Trump’s tariff threats remain a lingering unknown. “We do not believe that the impact of policies will be felt linearly but rather more episodically,” said Joe Gilbert, portfolio manager at Integrity Asset Management. Nonetheless, the portfolio manager expects elevated volatility this year, with market-friendly policies like taxes and tariff removals loaded more toward the back-end of the year. New Haven? This week’s selloff in shares of American tech giants gave rise to a new alternative destination: US value stocks. This sector was the preferred haven for 39% of respondents, compared with 23% who opted for Treasuries or 12% who favored the US dollar. Investors piled into value shares, which include everything from financial companies to health care and industrials stocks, and are typically more sensitive to economic swings. That has propelled the likes of the Vanguard S&P 500 Value Index Fund ETF, which houses bellwethers like Johnson & Johnson, Procter & Gamble Co. and Coca-Cola Co.    It is edging out its counterpart — the Vanguard S&P 500 Growth Index Fund ETF — by less than a percentage point in January following four straight months of underperformance, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. If that holds through Friday, it would be the widest monthly gap since August. Survey-takers remain optimistic on the S&P 500, with their median estimate for the benchmark to climb toward 6,500 by year-end — that would represent a 7.1% gain from Thursday’s close. --With assistance from Jessica Menton.

Liang, 40, on Tuesday returned to Mililing village in Zhanjiang, a port city in southern Guangdong province, where a red banner was raised hailing the low-profile tech entrepreneur as \"hometown pride\" for bringing honour to the local community, according to social-media posts. His visit on Lunar New Year\\'s Eve marks the day when Chinese families traditionally hold reunions during this national public holiday. It also raised the profile of Liang\\'s hometown, which has turned into a tourist attraction based on its DeepSeek connection, amid an influx of domestic visitors to the remote village, according to a report by Yangcheng Evening News, a state-backed publication based in Guangzhou, capital of Guangdong.

Hangzhou-based DeepSeek sent shock waves through Wall Street and Silicon Valley for developing AI models at a fraction of the cost and computing power that US tech firms like OpenAI, Google and Meta Platforms typically invest in such projects.    A red banner hung on a wall hails \"hometown pride\" Liang Wenfeng, founder and chief executive of DeepSeek, for bringing honour to Mililing village in Zhanjiang, a port city in southern Guangdong province. Photo: Weibo alt=A red banner hung on a wall hails \"hometown pride\" Liang Wenfeng, founder and chief executive of DeepSeek, for bringing honour to Mililing village in Zhanjiang, a port city in southern Guangdong province. Photo: Weibo> The heightened domestic and international attention given to DeepSeek and its founder reflects the AI community\\'s admiration for the firm\\'s low-cost development of world-class models - which either surpassed or matched the performance of rival products across a range of industry benchmark tests - in spite of tightened US restrictions on China\\'s access to advanced semiconductors and related technologies. An unidentified fellow Mililing villager was quoted by Yangcheng Evening News as saying that Liang was gifted growing up there, adding that \"he taught himself senior high-school maths when he was still a junior\".  Story Continues    During the 2002-2010 period when he studied in Zhejiang University, Liang developed an interest in applying machine-learning technology to quantitative trading. In 2015, Liang founded High-Flyer Quant, which uses deep-learning algorithms to run what has become one of the largest quantitative hedge funds in mainland China. In 2023, the company spun off DeepSeek as an independent enterprise. There are certain similarities between Liang and Jim Simons, the American quantitative hedge fund manager and mathematician, according to journalist Gregory Zuckerman, who wrote a book about the US billionaire titled The Man Who Solved the Market.    Liang apparently draws inspiration from Simons and agreed to write the preface of the book\\'s Chinese edition, Zuckerman reported in The Wall Street Journal. \"The publication of this book unravels many previously unresolved mysteries and brings us a wealth of experiences to learn from,\" Liang wrote in the preface. Liang also pointed out that whenever he encounters difficulties at work, he recalls Simons\\' words: \"There must be a way to model prices.\" This article originally appeared in the South China Morning Post (SCMP), the most authoritative voice reporting on China and Asia for more than a century.

The kicker here is that DeepSeek reportedly accomplished this using significantly less computational power, relying on fewer and less advanced AI chips -- particularly Nvidia's (NASDAQ: NVDA) cutting-edge GPUs, which are typically considered essential for such tasks.

Dan Victor, The Motley Fool   Sat, Feb 1, 2025, 4:12 AM 5 min read                   In This Article:    NVDA       DeepSeek, a Chinese artificial intelligence (AI) start-up, is sending shock waves through the U.S. tech sector by demonstrating its latest AI assistant, which achieves performance comparable to or even surpassing some of the world\\'s best chatbots. The kicker here is that DeepSeek reportedly accomplished this using significantly less computational power, relying on fewer and less advanced AI chips -- particularly Nvidia\\'s (NASDAQ: NVDA) cutting-edge GPUs, which are typically considered essential for such tasks.    This development suggests a potentially disruptive method for developing large language models (LLMs), offering a more efficient alternative to current strategies. It raises questions about future infrastructure investments and the demand for AI chips. The market\\'s reaction has been swift: As of this wriging, Nvidia\\'s stock has plunged more than 22% from its recent peak, with similar declines in other leading AI tech stocks. Let\\'s explore what DeepSeek\\'s emergence could mean for Nvidia and how it might affect investors\\' portfolios. The innovation behind DeepSeek\\'s success Artificial intelligence is not only a major theme in technology but also a national security issue, given its pivotal role in areas like data analysis, intelligence, and military applications. This has led the United States to impose bans or severe restrictions on exporting high-end technologies, such as specialized AI semiconductors, to China since 2023, aiming to slow the country\\'s technological progress and safeguard crucial supply chains. Despite these constraints, DeepSeek managed to develop AI models like DeepSeek-V3 and DeepSeek-R1 with cutting-edge capabilities on a reported training budget of around $6 million. Its white paper outlines an innovative approach that combines software ingenuity with new training techniques to maximize the potential of older Nvidia GPUs, surpassing their initial capabilities.    DeepSeek\\'s models have shown impressive results next to market-leading alternatives from OpenAI, Alphabet, and Meta Platforms in benchmarks for problem-solving, mathematical reasoning, coding, and general knowledge. The DeepSeek AI Assistant rapidly ascended to become the most-downloaded free application on the Apple App Store in the United States, demonstrating significant market traction and consumer acceptance. DeepSeek\\'s disruptive influence is further underscored by its open-source platform, which makes the code publicly accessible, allowing businesses and developers to customize AI models without incurring the high costs of proprietary systems. For those seeking to integrate DeepSeek\\'s most advanced models into existing tech infrastructure via an application programming interface (api), the company reportedly offers commercial pricing that is significantly lower than that of its competitors.  Story Continues      Image source: Getty Images.   Implications for Nvidia DeepSeek\\'s emergence has multiple implications for the broader tech sector. Given the initial sell-off, the market has interpreted this development as decisively negative, likely based on a concern that novel AI development methods could reduce the demand for cutting-edge, expensive hardware and cut into the competitive moat of established leaders. That being said, the impact on Nvidia may be more nuanced as it looks like the next-generation AI chips, including Nvidia\\'s Blackwell GPU architecture, are essential for pushing the boundaries of high-performance computing.    If DeepSeek managed to break AI performance benchmarks with legacy hardware, its methods toward computational efficiency implemented by other tech players could make Nvidia\\'s high-end products incrementally even more powerful. This scenario could help expand the AI market by opening up new uses that may become cost-effective while accelerating the timetable toward future breakthroughs like artificial general intelligence (AGI) applications as a demand driver for Nvidia. On the other hand, it is also clear that DeepSeek has introduced a new layer of complexity regarding Nvidia\\'s growth runway. According to Wall Street analysts monitored by Yahoo! Finance, the chipmaker is expected to reach $197 billion in revenue in fiscal 2026, which ends in January 2026, driving a 51% increase in earnings per share (EPS) to $4.45. Any sign that customers are pivoting away from large orders, even at the margin, would undermine this earnings outlook and further pressure the stock. The company\\'s upcoming fiscal 2025 fourth-quarter and full-year earnings report, set to be released on Feb. 26, will provide Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang and hist eam a chance to address whether DeepSeek is affecting the business and reassure shareholders.  Metric  FY 2025 Analyst Estimate  FY 2026 Analyst Estimate   Revenue  $129.2 billion  $196.5 billion   Revenue growth (YOY)  112%  52%   EPS  $2.95  $4.45   EPS growth (YOY)  127%  51%    Data source: Yahoo! Finance. FY = fiscal year. YOY = year over year. The big picture for investors DeepSeek appears to have signaled a new shift toward efficiency in AI software, highlighting the rapidly changing landscape. Recognizing near-term uncertainties with an expectation for volatility to continue, I believe investors should stay the course with Nvidia as an AI leader with a technological edge in hardware. Unless there is evidence that its financials are under pressure, a positive long-term outlook should support the stock, which remains well positioned to rebound.

Chinese AI lab DeepSeek broke into the mainstream consciousness this week after its chatbot app rose to the top of the Apple App Store charts (and Google Play, as well). DeepSeek’s AI models, which were trained using compute-efficient techniques, have led Wall Street analysts — and technologists — to question whether the U.S. can maintain its lead in the AI race and whether the demand for AI chips will sustain. But where did DeepSeek come from, and how did it rise to international fame so quickly? DeepSeek\\'s trader origins DeepSeek is backed by High-Flyer Capital Management, a Chinese quantitative hedge fund that uses AI to inform its trading decisions. AI enthusiast Liang Wenfeng co-founded High-Flyer in 2015. Wenfeng, who reportedly began dabbling in trading while a student at Zhejiang University, launched High-Flyer Capital Management as a hedge fund in 2019 focused on developing and deploying AI algorithms.    In 2023, High-Flyer started DeepSeek as a lab dedicated to researching AI tools separate from its financial business. With High-Flyer as one of its investors, the lab spun off into its own company, also called DeepSeek. From day one, DeepSeek built its own data center clusters for model training. But like other AI companies in China, DeepSeek has been affected by U.S. export bans on hardware. To train one of its more recent models, the company was forced to use Nvidia H800 chips, a less-powerful version of a chip, the H100, available to U.S. companies. DeepSeek\\'s technical team is said to skew young. The company reportedly aggressively recruits doctorate AI researchers from top Chinese universities. DeepSeek also hires people without any computer science background to help its tech better understand a wide range of subjects, per The New York Times. DeepSeek\\'s strong models DeepSeek unveiled its first set of models — DeepSeek Coder, DeepSeek LLM, and DeepSeek Chat — in November 2023. But it wasn\\'t until last spring, when the startup released its next-gen DeepSeek-V2 family of models, that the AI industry started to take notice. DeepSeek-V2, a general-purpose text- and image-analyzing system, performed well in various AI benchmarks — and was far cheaper to run than comparable models at the time. It forced DeepSeek\\'s domestic competition, including ByteDance and Alibaba, to cut the usage prices for some of their models, and make others completely free.    DeepSeek-V3, launched in December 2024, only added to DeepSeek\\'s notoriety. According to DeepSeek’s internal benchmark testing, DeepSeek V3 outperforms both downloadable, openly available models like Meta’s\\xa0Llama and “closed” models that can only be accessed through an API, like OpenAI\\'s GPT-4o.  Story Continues    Equally impressive is DeepSeek\\'s R1 \"reasoning\" model. Released in January, DeepSeek claims R1 performs as well as OpenAI’s\\xa0o1\\xa0model on key benchmarks. Being a reasoning model, R1 effectively fact-checks itself, which\\xa0helps it to avoid some of the\\xa0pitfalls\\xa0that normally trip up models. Reasoning models take a little longer — usually seconds to minutes longer — to arrive at solutions compared to a typical non-reasoning model. The upside is that they tend to be more reliable in domains such as physics, science, and math.    There is a downside to R1, DeepSeek V3, and DeepSeek\\'s other models, however. Being Chinese-developed AI, they\\'re subject to\\xa0benchmarking\\xa0by China’s internet regulator to ensure that its responses \"embody core socialist values.\" In DeepSeek\\'s chatbot app, for example, R1 won’t answer questions about Tiananmen Square or Taiwan’s autonomy. A disruptive approach If DeepSeek has a business model, it\\'s not clear what that model is, exactly. The company prices its products and services well below market value — and gives others away for free. The way DeepSeek tells it, efficiency breakthroughs have enabled it to maintain extreme cost competitiveness. Some experts dispute the figures the company has supplied, however. Whatever the case may be, developers have taken to DeepSeek\\'s models, which aren\\'t open source as the phrase is commonly understood but are available under permissive licenses that allow for commercial use. According to Clem Delangue, the CEO of Hugging Face, one of the platforms hosting DeepSeek\\'s models, developers on Hugging Face have created over 500 “derivative” models of R1 that have racked up 2.5 million downloads combined.    DeepSeek\\'s success against larger and more established rivals has been described as \"upending AI\" and \"over-hyped.\" The company\\'s success was at least in part responsible for causing Nvidia\\'s stock price to drop by 18% on Monday, and for eliciting a public response from OpenAI CEO Sam Altman. Microsoft announced that DeepSeek is available on its Azure AI Foundry service, Microsoft\\'s platform that brings together AI services for enterprises under a single banner. When asked about DeepSeek\\'s impact on Meta\\'s AI spending during its first-quarter earnings call, CEO Mark Zuckerberg said spending on AI infrastructure will continue to be a “strategic advantage” for Meta. As for what DeepSeek\\'s future might hold, it\\'s not clear. Improved models are a given. But the U.S. government appears to be growing wary of what it perceives as harmful foreign influence.

Most Read from Bloomberg  How the 2025 Catholic Jubilee Is Reshaping Rome  Trump Paves the Way to Deputize Local Police on Immigration  Manhattan’s Morning Commute Time Drops With New Congestion Toll  Historic London Elevator Faces Last Stop in Labour’s Housing Push  Housing Aid Uncertain After Trump’s Spending Freeze Memo      Of the 260 respondents, 88% said the debut of the startup’s latest model — which wiped $784 billion from the S&P 500 on Monday — will have little to no impact on the shares of the US technology behemoths in coming weeks. Few are cutting their exposure to the S&P 500, an index dominated by the massive tech companies. Instead, it will be President Donald Trump’s policies that drive equity volatility this year, according to 59% of participants in a survey conducted from Jan. 28-30. With the S&P 500’s leadership more concentrated than it has been in over 20 years, investors and strategists have frequently warned that volatility in the handful of megacap names that have pulled indexes higher could hurt broader markets. Monday’s selloff had its share of eye-watering moves, including AI darling Nvidia Corp’s $589 billion drop in market value, the biggest single-day loss of value for any public company in history. Yet beyond tech stocks, the impact on the broader market was largely contained. The S&P 500’s decline of 1.5% on that day was only the index’s biggest loss in 10 sessions. The benchmark index rose 0.5% on Thursday, paring earlier gains after Trump said he would follow through on threats to impose 25% tariffs on Canada and Mexico on Feb. 1. It has made up most of the ground lost in Monday’s drop.    Disruptors Disrupted Dethroning the Magnificent Seven won’t be easy, as the companies have been able to build significant competitive moats around their businesses, said Steve Sosnick, chief strategist at Interactive Brokers LLC. Still, Monday’s selloff reminds Wall Street that “even disruptors are at risk of being disrupted,” he says. “If companies are earning outsized profits, it is inevitable that competitors will arise in hopes of reaping some of those gains.” Major tech firms reporting earnings this week remain bullish on their competitiveness in the AI race. Meta Platforms Inc. Chief Executive Officer Mark Zuckerberg said 2025 will be a “really big year” for his company’s AI strategy. His comments came after the company unveiled higher-than-estimated capital expenditure last week, raising concerns it would struggle to monetize its AI investments.  Story Continues    Meanwhile, Microsoft Corp. said its cloud-computing business will continue to grow slowly in the current quarter as the behemoth struggles to build enough data centers to meet demand for its AI products. Nvidia Corp. is scheduled to report results on February 26. Overblown Reaction When asked how DeepSeek’s emergence would affect their investments, 63% of survey participants said they have no plans to change their exposure to the S&P 500. More than half said this week’s rout was overblown, given questions over how DeepSeek managed to release an AI model that it claims cost a fraction of what US industry leaders spent on theirs.    With respondents seeing the Trump administration as a bigger catalyst than AI for stock performance this year, Trump’s tariff threats remain a lingering unknown. “We do not believe that the impact of policies will be felt linearly but rather more episodically,” said Joe Gilbert, portfolio manager at Integrity Asset Management. Nonetheless, the portfolio manager expects elevated volatility this year, with market-friendly policies like taxes and tariff removals loaded more toward the back-end of the year. New Haven? This week’s selloff in shares of American tech giants gave rise to a new alternative destination: US value stocks. This sector was the preferred haven for 39% of respondents, compared with 23% who opted for Treasuries or 12% who favored the US dollar. Investors piled into value shares, which include everything from financial companies to health care and industrials stocks, and are typically more sensitive to economic swings. That has propelled the likes of the Vanguard S&P 500 Value Index Fund ETF, which houses bellwethers like Johnson & Johnson, Procter & Gamble Co. and Coca-Cola Co.    It is edging out its counterpart — the Vanguard S&P 500 Growth Index Fund ETF — by less than a percentage point in January following four straight months of underperformance, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. If that holds through Friday, it would be the widest monthly gap since August. Survey-takers remain optimistic on the S&P 500, with their median estimate for the benchmark to climb toward 6,500 by year-end — that would represent a 7.1% gain from Thursday’s close. --With assistance from Jessica Menton.

Shares have lost over 12% this week after the emergence of a sophisticated, lower-cost AI model from Chinese startup DeepSeek spurred a reckoning\\xa0on Wall Street about AI spending.  Analysts have largely remained bullish on the chipmaker\\'s stock, suggesting the market\\'s reaction may have been overblown.       Nvidia (NVDA) CEO Jensen Huang is set to meet with President Donald Trump at the White House, Bloomberg reported Friday, after a wild week for the chipmaker\\'s stock. Shares wavered between gains and losses near $125 in afternoon trading Friday, having lost more than 12% of their value this week after the rapid rise of Chinese AI startup DeepSeek rattled markets. The surging popularity of an app from DeepSeek, which claimed it developed an AI model rivaling the performance of American competitors for a fraction of the cost, spurred a reckoning on Wall Street about the competitiveness of American AI leaders and their spending on tech, sending shares of Nvidia and other AI stocks into a tailspin earlier in the week. Still, analysts have largely remained bullish on the chipmaker\\'s stock, with Bank of America telling clients Wednesday they \"view the recent selloff as an enhanced buy opportunity.\" Analysts at Bernstein, Citi, Wedbush, Raymond James, and elsewhere were also among those that suggested the market’s reaction may have been overblown.    Raymond James and Bank of America added that they expect competition from China could push Big Tech companies like Microsoft (MSFT), Amazon (AMZN), and Alphabet (GOOGL) to spend even more on AI, to the benefit of Nvidia, Broadcom (AVGO), and other AI chipmakers. In earnings calls this week, executives from Microsoft and Meta stood by their plans to spend billions of dollars this year on AI infrastructure. Huang\\'s meeting at the White House also comes following reports the Trump administration could be considering further tightening restrictions on sales of advanced U.S. chips to China. Nvidia reported in November that sales to China accounted for more than 15% of the chipmaker\\'s revenues in its fiscal third quarter. Nvidia is set to report its fourth-quarter results on Feb. 26.

Chief Executive Officer Jensen Huang at the White House as the US prepares tariffs on semiconductors, weighs the fate of a chip subsidy program and probes whether Chinese AI startup DeepSeek skirted export controls to obtain the company’s products.    Most Read from Bloomberg  How the 2025 Catholic Jubilee Is Reshaping Rome  Trump Paves the Way to Deputize Local Police on Immigration  Manhattan’s Morning Commute Time Drops With New Congestion Toll  Historic London Elevator Faces Last Stop in Labour’s Housing Push  Housing Aid Uncertain After Trump’s Spending Freeze Memo   Chip tariffs would weigh heavily on Nvidia, which relies on overseas partners to manufacture its semiconductors. Trump told reporters he’d had a good meeting with Huang, but insisted “eventually we’re going to put tariffs on chips.” In response to a question about the potential for more restrictions on chip exports to China, the president said he will move forward with tariffs. Current limitations on shipping to China take the form of license requirements administered by the Department of Commerce. An Nvidia spokesperson said Huang “appreciated the opportunity to meet with President Trump and discuss semiconductors and AI policy.” The two talked about “the importance of strengthening US technology and AI leadership,” the spokesperson said.    The meeting came at the end of a rocky week for Nvidia, the top maker of chips to power artificial intelligence workloads. DeepSeek released its R1 model, which is seen as competitive with chatbots from other companies at a fraction of the cost. That raised questions about the billions in planned spending to develop AI technology and whether Beijing has closed the gap with the US in the sphere. The ensuing market reaction was particularly stark for Nvidia, with shares of the company plunging Monday in one of the biggest selloffs in history. Investors are concerned that DeepSeek’s method for developing effective AI software doesn’t require as much of the expensive gear that Nvidia sells. Nvidia shares declined 3.7% to $120.07 at the close Friday, bringing the stock’s cumulative slide to 16% this week. Trump administration officials have begun probing whether DeepSeek purchased banned Nvidia chips through intermediaries in Singapore, circumventing US restrictions on the sales of processors used for AI tasks, according to people familiar with the matter. Huang’s meeting with Trump has been in the works for several weeks, according to a person familiar with the matter. The goal was to discuss AI policy, and it wasn’t prompted by the DeepSeek breakthrough, said the person, who described the plans on condition of anonymity.  Story Continues    The Nvidia CEO had floated meeting with Trump earlier this month, when he signaled hope for a lighter regulatory touch from the new administration. Unlike other tech leaders, including Meta Platforms Inc. CEO Mark Zuckerberg and Amazon.com Inc. co-founder Jeff Bezos, Huang skipped Trump’s inauguration in Washington and instead traveled to Asia on a long-planned trip around the Lunar New Year. The plans for the Trump and Huang meeting were reported earlier by Gray Television News. Friday’s sit-down was the first meeting between the pair. Nvidia is central to the AI boom, and its chips have assumed geopolitical significance in the intensifying race between the US and China over artificial intelligence.    The company has lobbied furiously in recent weeks against sweeping controls on the global sales of its processors, and Huang has expressed optimism about the possibility of easing regulatory burdens under Trump’s administration. It will take months for Trump to fully staff the teams responsible for those policies, but there are early indications that his administration will take a tough approach on sales of US technology to China. Some Trump officials are interested in curbing exports of less-advanced chips that Nvidia sells. Howard Lutnick, Trump’s pick for Commerce secretary, during his confirmation hearing on Wednesday suggested that DeepSeek had evaded US export controls and pledged a “very strong” response. If confirmed, Lutnick would be in charge of the Bureau of Industry and Security, which is responsible for writing and enforcing sweeping controls on sales of chips and related manufacturing equipment to China. Trump last week unveiled a $100 billion artificial intelligence infrastructure investment — with goals of $500 billion down the road — from OpenAI, SoftBank Group Corp. and Oracle Corp.    Trump has said new “AI solutions” from the US would be introduced in the near future. On Thursday, OpenAI CEO Sam Altman teased new advances in the company’s products in a closed-door meeting in Washington attended by officials from Congress and the White House. He used the gathering to urge US policymakers to invest heavily in physical infrastructure to support artificial intelligence development. --With assistance from Caroline Hyde, Romy Varghese and Ian King.

       "Based on the news articles, it appears that DeepSeek, a Chinese artificial intelligence startup, has made significant advancements in its AI model, which has raised concerns among investors and analysts. The company's ability to produce an AI model comparable to some of the best in the US, but using significantly less computational power and fewer advanced AI chips, particularly those from Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA), has sparked debate about the potential disruption to the AI industry.\n",
       "\n",
       "The emergence of DeepSeek has caused investors to question everything they thought they knew about artificial intelligence, and it has also raised concerns about the demand for AI chips and the potential impact on Nvidia's stock price. Some analysts have expressed skepticism about the company's ability to maintain its lead in the AI race, while others see it as a silver lining.\n",
       "\n",
       "However, it's worth noting that DeepSeek's impact goes beyond just AI, and it has also created a problem for stocks. The company's low-cost approach has raised questions about the sustainability of Nvidia's business model and the potential for disruption to the chip industry.\n",
       "\n",
       "In terms of specific market impacts, some analysts have expressed concerns about the potential decline in Nvidia's stock price due to DeepSeek's emergence. However, others see limited scope for the Chinese startup to dent the performance of the Magnificent Seven stocks, which include Nvidia.\n",
       "\n",
       "Overall, while DeepSeek has raised concerns among investors and analysts, it's still early days to determine the full impact on Nvidia's stock price. The company's ability to maintain its lead in the AI race and its business model will be crucial in determining the outcome.\n",
       "\n",
       "Key points:\n",
       "\n",
       "* DeepSeek, a Chinese artificial intelligence startup, has made significant advancements in its AI model.\n",
       "* The company's ability to produce an AI model comparable to some of the best in the US, but using significantly less computational power and fewer advanced AI chips, particularly those from Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA), has sparked debate about the potential disruption to the AI industry.\n",

       "\n",
       "Recommendation:\n",
       "\n",
       "Based on the current information available, it's difficult to make a definitive recommendation on whether to buy or sell Nvidia stock. However, investors should keep a close eye on the company's ability to maintain its lead in the AI race and its business model, as well as the potential impact of DeepSeek's emergence on the chip industry.\n",
       "\n",
       "It's also worth noting that the US-China trade tensions and the potential tariffs on semiconductors could have a significant impact on Nvidia's stock price. The company's CEO, Jensen Huang, is set to meet with President Trump at the White House on Friday, which may provide some clarity on the situation.\n",
       "\n",
       "Ultimately, investors should conduct their own research and analysis before making any investment decisions."

Liang, 40, on Tuesday returned to Mililing village in Zhanjiang, a port city in southern Guangdong province, where a red banner was raised hailing the low-profile tech entrepreneur as \"hometown pride\" for bringing honour to the local community, according to social-media posts. His visit on Lunar New Year\\'s Eve marks the day when Chinese families traditionally hold reunions during this national public holiday. It also raised the profile of Liang\\'s hometown, which has turned into a tourist attraction based on its DeepSeek connection, amid an influx of domestic visitors to the remote village, according to a report by Yangcheng Evening News, a state-backed publication based in Guangzhou, capital of Guangdong.

Hangzhou-based DeepSeek sent shock waves through Wall Street and Silicon Valley for developing AI models at a fraction of the cost and computing power that US tech firms like OpenAI, Google and Meta Platforms typically invest in such projects.    A red banner hung on a wall hails \"hometown pride\" Liang Wenfeng, founder and chief executive of DeepSeek, for bringing honour to Mililing village in Zhanjiang, a port city in southern Guangdong province. Photo: Weibo alt=A red banner hung on a wall hails \"hometown pride\" Liang Wenfeng, founder and chief executive of DeepSeek, for bringing honour to Mililing village in Zhanjiang, a port city in southern Guangdong province. Photo: Weibo> The heightened domestic and international attention given to DeepSeek and its founder reflects the AI community\\'s admiration for the firm\\'s low-cost development of world-class models - which either surpassed or matched the performance of rival products across a range of industry benchmark tests - in spite of tightened US restrictions on China\\'s access to advanced semiconductors and related technologies. An unidentified fellow Mililing villager was quoted by Yangcheng Evening News as saying that Liang was gifted growing up there, adding that \"he taught himself senior high-school maths when he was still a junior\".  Story Continues    During the 2002-2010 period when he studied in Zhejiang University, Liang developed an interest in applying machine-learning technology to quantitative trading. In 2015, Liang founded High-Flyer Quant, which uses deep-learning algorithms to run what has become one of the largest quantitative hedge funds in mainland China. In 2023, the company spun off DeepSeek as an independent enterprise. There are certain similarities between Liang and Jim Simons, the American quantitative hedge fund manager and mathematician, according to journalist Gregory Zuckerman, who wrote a book about the US billionaire titled The Man Who Solved the Market.    Liang apparently draws inspiration from Simons and agreed to write the preface of the book\\'s Chinese edition, Zuckerman reported in The Wall Street Journal. \"The publication of this book unravels many previously unresolved mysteries and brings us a wealth of experiences to learn from,\" Liang wrote in the preface. Liang also pointed out that whenever he encounters difficulties at work, he recalls Simons\\' words: \"There must be a way to model prices.\" This article originally appeared in the South China Morning Post (SCMP), the most authoritative voice reporting on China and Asia for more than a century.

Dan Victor, The Motley Fool   Sat, Feb 1, 2025, 4:12 AM 5 min read                   In This Article:    NVDA       DeepSeek, a Chinese artificial intelligence (AI) start-up, is sending shock waves through the U.S. tech sector by demonstrating its latest AI assistant, which achieves performance comparable to or even surpassing some of the world\\'s best chatbots. The kicker here is that DeepSeek reportedly accomplished this using significantly less computational power, relying on fewer and less advanced AI chips -- particularly Nvidia\\'s (NASDAQ: NVDA) cutting-edge GPUs, which are typically considered essential for such tasks.    This development suggests a potentially disruptive method for developing large language models (LLMs), offering a more efficient alternative to current strategies. It raises questions about future infrastructure investments and the demand for AI chips. The market\\'s reaction has been swift: As of this wriging, Nvidia\\'s stock has plunged more than 22% from its recent peak, with similar declines in other leading AI tech stocks. Let\\'s explore what DeepSeek\\'s emergence could mean for Nvidia and how it might affect investors\\' portfolios. The innovation behind DeepSeek\\'s success Artificial intelligence is not only a major theme in technology but also a national security issue, given its pivotal role in areas like data analysis, intelligence, and military applications. This has led the United States to impose bans or severe restrictions on exporting high-end technologies, such as specialized AI semiconductors, to China since 2023, aiming to slow the country\\'s technological progress and safeguard crucial supply chains. Despite these constraints, DeepSeek managed to develop AI models like DeepSeek-V3 and DeepSeek-R1 with cutting-edge capabilities on a reported training budget of around $6 million. Its white paper outlines an innovative approach that combines software ingenuity with new training techniques to maximize the potential of older Nvidia GPUs, surpassing their initial capabilities.    DeepSeek\\'s models have shown impressive results next to market-leading alternatives from OpenAI, Alphabet, and Meta Platforms in benchmarks for problem-solving, mathematical reasoning, coding, and general knowledge. The DeepSeek AI Assistant rapidly ascended to become the most-downloaded free application on the Apple App Store in the United States, demonstrating significant market traction and consumer acceptance. DeepSeek\\'s disruptive influence is further underscored by its open-source platform, which makes the code publicly accessible, allowing businesses and developers to customize AI models without incurring the high costs of proprietary systems. For those seeking to integrate DeepSeek\\'s most advanced models into existing tech infrastructure via an application programming interface (api), the company reportedly offers commercial pricing that is significantly lower than that of its competitors.  Story Continues      Image source: Getty Images.   Implications for Nvidia DeepSeek\\'s emergence has multiple implications for the broader tech sector. Given the initial sell-off, the market has interpreted this development as decisively negative, likely based on a concern that novel AI development methods could reduce the demand for cutting-edge, expensive hardware and cut into the competitive moat of established leaders. That being said, the impact on Nvidia may be more nuanced as it looks like the next-generation AI chips, including Nvidia\\'s Blackwell GPU architecture, are essential for pushing the boundaries of high-performance computing.    If DeepSeek managed to break AI performance benchmarks with legacy hardware, its methods toward computational efficiency implemented by other tech players could make Nvidia\\'s high-end products incrementally even more powerful. This scenario could help expand the AI market by opening up new uses that may become cost-effective while accelerating the timetable toward future breakthroughs like artificial general intelligence (AGI) applications as a demand driver for Nvidia. On the other hand, it is also clear that DeepSeek has introduced a new layer of complexity regarding Nvidia\\'s growth runway. According to Wall Street analysts monitored by Yahoo! Finance, the chipmaker is expected to reach $197 billion in revenue in fiscal 2026, which ends in January 2026, driving a 51% increase in earnings per share (EPS) to $4.45. Any sign that customers are pivoting away from large orders, even at the margin, would undermine this earnings outlook and further pressure the stock. The company\\'s upcoming fiscal 2025 fourth-quarter and full-year earnings report, set to be released on Feb. 26, will provide Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang and hist eam a chance to address whether DeepSeek is affecting the business and reassure shareholders.  Metric  FY 2025 Analyst Estimate  FY 2026 Analyst Estimate   Revenue  $129.2 billion  $196.5 billion   Revenue growth (YOY)  112%  52%   EPS  $2.95  $4.45   EPS growth (YOY)  127%  51%    Data source: Yahoo! Finance. FY = fiscal year. YOY = year over year. The big picture for investors DeepSeek appears to have signaled a new shift toward efficiency in AI software, highlighting the rapidly changing landscape. Recognizing near-term uncertainties with an expectation for volatility to continue, I believe investors should stay the course with Nvidia as an AI leader with a technological edge in hardware. Unless there is evidence that its financials are under pressure, a positive long-term outlook should support the stock, which remains well positioned to rebound.

Chinese AI lab DeepSeek broke into the mainstream consciousness this week after its chatbot app rose to the top of the Apple App Store charts (and Google Play, as well). DeepSeek’s AI models, which were trained using compute-efficient techniques, have led Wall Street analysts — and technologists — to question whether the U.S. can maintain its lead in the AI race and whether the demand for AI chips will sustain. But where did DeepSeek come from, and how did it rise to international fame so quickly? DeepSeek\\'s trader origins DeepSeek is backed by High-Flyer Capital Management, a Chinese quantitative hedge fund that uses AI to inform its trading decisions. AI enthusiast Liang Wenfeng co-founded High-Flyer in 2015. Wenfeng, who reportedly began dabbling in trading while a student at Zhejiang University, launched High-Flyer Capital Management as a hedge fund in 2019 focused on developing and deploying AI algorithms.    In 2023, High-Flyer started DeepSeek as a lab dedicated to researching AI tools separate from its financial business. With High-Flyer as one of its investors, the lab spun off into its own company, also called DeepSeek. From day one, DeepSeek built its own data center clusters for model training. But like other AI companies in China, DeepSeek has been affected by U.S. export bans on hardware. To train one of its more recent models, the company was forced to use Nvidia H800 chips, a less-powerful version of a chip, the H100, available to U.S. companies. DeepSeek\\'s technical team is said to skew young. The company reportedly aggressively recruits doctorate AI researchers from top Chinese universities. DeepSeek also hires people without any computer science background to help its tech better understand a wide range of subjects, per The New York Times. DeepSeek\\'s strong models DeepSeek unveiled its first set of models — DeepSeek Coder, DeepSeek LLM, and DeepSeek Chat — in November 2023. But it wasn\\'t until last spring, when the startup released its next-gen DeepSeek-V2 family of models, that the AI industry started to take notice. DeepSeek-V2, a general-purpose text- and image-analyzing system, performed well in various AI benchmarks — and was far cheaper to run than comparable models at the time. It forced DeepSeek\\'s domestic competition, including ByteDance and Alibaba, to cut the usage prices for some of their models, and make others completely free.    DeepSeek-V3, launched in December 2024, only added to DeepSeek\\'s notoriety. According to DeepSeek’s internal benchmark testing, DeepSeek V3 outperforms both downloadable, openly available models like Meta’s\\xa0Llama and “closed” models that can only be accessed through an API, like OpenAI\\'s GPT-4o.  Story Continues    Equally impressive is DeepSeek\\'s R1 \"reasoning\" model. Released in January, DeepSeek claims R1 performs as well as OpenAI’s\\xa0o1\\xa0model on key benchmarks. Being a reasoning model, R1 effectively fact-checks itself, which\\xa0helps it to avoid some of the\\xa0pitfalls\\xa0that normally trip up models. Reasoning models take a little longer — usually seconds to minutes longer — to arrive at solutions compared to a typical non-reasoning model. The upside is that they tend to be more reliable in domains such as physics, science, and math.    There is a downside to R1, DeepSeek V3, and DeepSeek\\'s other models, however. Being Chinese-developed AI, they\\'re subject to\\xa0benchmarking\\xa0by China’s internet regulator to ensure that its responses \"embody core socialist values.\" In DeepSeek\\'s chatbot app, for example, R1 won’t answer questions about Tiananmen Square or Taiwan’s autonomy. A disruptive approach If DeepSeek has a business model, it\\'s not clear what that model is, exactly. The company prices its products and services well below market value — and gives others away for free. The way DeepSeek tells it, efficiency breakthroughs have enabled it to maintain extreme cost competitiveness. Some experts dispute the figures the company has supplied, however. Whatever the case may be, developers have taken to DeepSeek\\'s models, which aren\\'t open source as the phrase is commonly understood but are available under permissive licenses that allow for commercial use. According to Clem Delangue, the CEO of Hugging Face, one of the platforms hosting DeepSeek\\'s models, developers on Hugging Face have created over 500 “derivative” models of R1 that have racked up 2.5 million downloads combined.    DeepSeek\\'s success against larger and more established rivals has been described as \"upending AI\" and \"over-hyped.\" The company\\'s success was at least in part responsible for causing Nvidia\\'s stock price to drop by 18% on Monday, and for eliciting a public response from OpenAI CEO Sam Altman. Microsoft announced that DeepSeek is available on its Azure AI Foundry service, Microsoft\\'s platform that brings together AI services for enterprises under a single banner. When asked about DeepSeek\\'s impact on Meta\\'s AI spending during its first-quarter earnings call, CEO Mark Zuckerberg said spending on AI infrastructure will continue to be a “strategic advantage” for Meta. As for what DeepSeek\\'s future might hold, it\\'s not clear. Improved models are a given. But the U.S. government appears to be growing wary of what it perceives as harmful foreign influence.

Most Read from Bloomberg  How the 2025 Catholic Jubilee Is Reshaping Rome  Trump Paves the Way to Deputize Local Police on Immigration  Manhattan’s Morning Commute Time Drops With New Congestion Toll  Historic London Elevator Faces Last Stop in Labour’s Housing Push  Housing Aid Uncertain After Trump’s Spending Freeze Memo      Of the 260 respondents, 88% said the debut of the startup’s latest model — which wiped $784 billion from the S&P 500 on Monday — will have little to no impact on the shares of the US technology behemoths in coming weeks. Few are cutting their exposure to the S&P 500, an index dominated by the massive tech companies. Instead, it will be President Donald Trump’s policies that drive equity volatility this year, according to 59% of participants in a survey conducted from Jan. 28-30. With the S&P 500’s leadership more concentrated than it has been in over 20 years, investors and strategists have frequently warned that volatility in the handful of megacap names that have pulled indexes higher could hurt broader markets. Monday’s selloff had its share of eye-watering moves, including AI darling Nvidia Corp’s $589 billion drop in market value, the biggest single-day loss of value for any public company in history. Yet beyond tech stocks, the impact on the broader market was largely contained. The S&P 500’s decline of 1.5% on that day was only the index’s biggest loss in 10 sessions. The benchmark index rose 0.5% on Thursday, paring earlier gains after Trump said he would follow through on threats to impose 25% tariffs on Canada and Mexico on Feb. 1. It has made up most of the ground lost in Monday’s drop.    Disruptors Disrupted Dethroning the Magnificent Seven won’t be easy, as the companies have been able to build significant competitive moats around their businesses, said Steve Sosnick, chief strategist at Interactive Brokers LLC. Still, Monday’s selloff reminds Wall Street that “even disruptors are at risk of being disrupted,” he says. “If companies are earning outsized profits, it is inevitable that competitors will arise in hopes of reaping some of those gains.” Major tech firms reporting earnings this week remain bullish on their competitiveness in the AI race. Meta Platforms Inc. Chief Executive Officer Mark Zuckerberg said 2025 will be a “really big year” for his company’s AI strategy. His comments came after the company unveiled higher-than-estimated capital expenditure last week, raising concerns it would struggle to monetize its AI investments.  Story Continues    Meanwhile, Microsoft Corp. said its cloud-computing business will continue to grow slowly in the current quarter as the behemoth struggles to build enough data centers to meet demand for its AI products. Nvidia Corp. is scheduled to report results on February 26. Overblown Reaction When asked how DeepSeek’s emergence would affect their investments, 63% of survey participants said they have no plans to change their exposure to the S&P 500. More than half said this week’s rout was overblown, given questions over how DeepSeek managed to release an AI model that it claims cost a fraction of what US industry leaders spent on theirs.    With respondents seeing the Trump administration as a bigger catalyst than AI for stock performance this year, Trump’s tariff threats remain a lingering unknown. “We do not believe that the impact of policies will be felt linearly but rather more episodically,” said Joe Gilbert, portfolio manager at Integrity Asset Management. Nonetheless, the portfolio manager expects elevated volatility this year, with market-friendly policies like taxes and tariff removals loaded more toward the back-end of the year. New Haven? This week’s selloff in shares of American tech giants gave rise to a new alternative destination: US value stocks. This sector was the preferred haven for 39% of respondents, compared with 23% who opted for Treasuries or 12% who favored the US dollar. Investors piled into value shares, which include everything from financial companies to health care and industrials stocks, and are typically more sensitive to economic swings. That has propelled the likes of the Vanguard S&P 500 Value Index Fund ETF, which houses bellwethers like Johnson & Johnson, Procter & Gamble Co. and Coca-Cola Co.    It is edging out its counterpart — the Vanguard S&P 500 Growth Index Fund ETF — by less than a percentage point in January following four straight months of underperformance, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. If that holds through Friday, it would be the widest monthly gap since August. Survey-takers remain optimistic on the S&P 500, with their median estimate for the benchmark to climb toward 6,500 by year-end — that would represent a 7.1% gain from Thursday’s close. --With assistance from Jessica Menton.

Shares have lost over 12% this week after the emergence of a sophisticated, lower-cost AI model from Chinese startup DeepSeek spurred a reckoning\\xa0on Wall Street about AI spending.  Analysts have largely remained bullish on the chipmaker\\'s stock, suggesting the market\\'s reaction may have been overblown.       Nvidia (NVDA) CEO Jensen Huang is set to meet with President Donald Trump at the White House, Bloomberg reported Friday, after a wild week for the chipmaker\\'s stock. Shares wavered between gains and losses near $125 in afternoon trading Friday, having lost more than 12% of their value this week after the rapid rise of Chinese AI startup DeepSeek rattled markets. The surging popularity of an app from DeepSeek, which claimed it developed an AI model rivaling the performance of American competitors for a fraction of the cost, spurred a reckoning on Wall Street about the competitiveness of American AI leaders and their spending on tech, sending shares of Nvidia and other AI stocks into a tailspin earlier in the week. Still, analysts have largely remained bullish on the chipmaker\\'s stock, with Bank of America telling clients Wednesday they \"view the recent selloff as an enhanced buy opportunity.\" Analysts at Bernstein, Citi, Wedbush, Raymond James, and elsewhere were also among those that suggested the market’s reaction may have been overblown.    Raymond James and Bank of America added that they expect competition from China could push Big Tech companies like Microsoft (MSFT), Amazon (AMZN), and Alphabet (GOOGL) to spend even more on AI, to the benefit of Nvidia, Broadcom (AVGO), and other AI chipmakers. In earnings calls this week, executives from Microsoft and Meta stood by their plans to spend billions of dollars this year on AI infrastructure. Huang\\'s meeting at the White House also comes following reports the Trump administration could be considering further tightening restrictions on sales of advanced U.S. chips to China. Nvidia reported in November that sales to China accounted for more than 15% of the chipmaker\\'s revenues in its fiscal third quarter. Nvidia is set to report its fourth-quarter results on Feb. 26.

Chief Executive Officer Jensen Huang at the White House as the US prepares tariffs on semiconductors, weighs the fate of a chip subsidy program and probes whether Chinese AI startup DeepSeek skirted export controls to obtain the company’s products.    Most Read from Bloomberg  How the 2025 Catholic Jubilee Is Reshaping Rome  Trump Paves the Way to Deputize Local Police on Immigration  Manhattan’s Morning Commute Time Drops With New Congestion Toll  Historic London Elevator Faces Last Stop in Labour’s Housing Push  Housing Aid Uncertain After Trump’s Spending Freeze Memo   Chip tariffs would weigh heavily on Nvidia, which relies on overseas partners to manufacture its semiconductors. Trump told reporters he’d had a good meeting with Huang, but insisted “eventually we’re going to put tariffs on chips.” In response to a question about the potential for more restrictions on chip exports to China, the president said he will move forward with tariffs. Current limitations on shipping to China take the form of license requirements administered by the Department of Commerce. An Nvidia spokesperson said Huang “appreciated the opportunity to meet with President Trump and discuss semiconductors and AI policy.” The two talked about “the importance of strengthening US technology and AI leadership,” the spokesperson said.    The meeting came at the end of a rocky week for Nvidia, the top maker of chips to power artificial intelligence workloads. DeepSeek released its R1 model, which is seen as competitive with chatbots from other companies at a fraction of the cost. That raised questions about the billions in planned spending to develop AI technology and whether Beijing has closed the gap with the US in the sphere. The ensuing market reaction was particularly stark for Nvidia, with shares of the company plunging Monday in one of the biggest selloffs in history. Investors are concerned that DeepSeek’s method for developing effective AI software doesn’t require as much of the expensive gear that Nvidia sells. Nvidia shares declined 3.7% to $120.07 at the close Friday, bringing the stock’s cumulative slide to 16% this week. Trump administration officials have begun probing whether DeepSeek purchased banned Nvidia chips through intermediaries in Singapore, circumventing US restrictions on the sales of processors used for AI tasks, according to people familiar with the matter. Huang’s meeting with Trump has been in the works for several weeks, according to a person familiar with the matter. The goal was to discuss AI policy, and it wasn’t prompted by the DeepSeek breakthrough, said the person, who described the plans on condition of anonymity.  Story Continues    The Nvidia CEO had floated meeting with Trump earlier this month, when he signaled hope for a lighter regulatory touch from the new administration. Unlike other tech leaders, including Meta Platforms Inc. CEO Mark Zuckerberg and Amazon.com Inc. co-founder Jeff Bezos, Huang skipped Trump’s inauguration in Washington and instead traveled to Asia on a long-planned trip around the Lunar New Year. The plans for the Trump and Huang meeting were reported earlier by Gray Television News. Friday’s sit-down was the first meeting between the pair. Nvidia is central to the AI boom, and its chips have assumed geopolitical significance in the intensifying race between the US and China over artificial intelligence.    The company has lobbied furiously in recent weeks against sweeping controls on the global sales of its processors, and Huang has expressed optimism about the possibility of easing regulatory burdens under Trump’s administration. It will take months for Trump to fully staff the teams responsible for those policies, but there are early indications that his administration will take a tough approach on sales of US technology to China. Some Trump officials are interested in curbing exports of less-advanced chips that Nvidia sells. Howard Lutnick, Trump’s pick for Commerce secretary, during his confirmation hearing on Wednesday suggested that DeepSeek had evaded US export controls and pledged a “very strong” response. If confirmed, Lutnick would be in charge of the Bureau of Industry and Security, which is responsible for writing and enforcing sweeping controls on sales of chips and related manufacturing equipment to China. Trump last week unveiled a $100 billion artificial intelligence infrastructure investment — with goals of $500 billion down the road — from OpenAI, SoftBank Group Corp. and Oracle Corp.    Trump has said new “AI solutions” from the US would be introduced in the near future. On Thursday, OpenAI CEO Sam Altman teased new advances in the company’s products in a closed-door meeting in Washington attended by officials from Congress and the White House. He used the gathering to urge US policymakers to invest heavily in physical infrastructure to support artificial intelligence development. --With assistance from Caroline Hyde, Romy Varghese and Ian King.
