Are Both Stocks Buys?Geoffrey Seiler, The Motley FoolSun, Jan 26, 2025, 8:30 PM6 min readLink Copied0Analysts at Jefferies recently ranked the so-called \"Magnificent Seven\" stocks based on which ones they thought would outperform in 2025. The name refers to a group of leading mega-cap tech stocks that have been helping lead the market higher the past couple of years.Its top picks among the group were Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) and Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOGL) (NASDAQ: GOOG). The group also includes, by order of Jefferies\\' rankings, Meta Platforms, Apple, Amazon, Tesla, and Microsoft.The firm\\'s rankings were based on several quantitative measures, including growth, valuation, yield, earnings revisions, sell-side analyst sentiment, return on invested capital (ROIC), stock price momentum, and research and development (R&D) versus capex (capital expenditures) spending.Nvidia grabbed the top spot largely due to its strong growth, upward guidance revisions, attractive valuation, and strong analyst sentiment.Let\\'s look at why I think both Nvidia and Alphabet stocks are attractive buys.1. NvidiaNvidia remains a great combination of incredibly strong growth at an attractive valuation. The company is on pace to report its second consecutive year of triple-digit revenue increases, which given its size is quite remarkable.Meanwhile, analysts are projecting more than 50% sales growth in 2025. And it is attractively valued with a forward price-to-earnings ratio (P/E) below 33 times and a price/earnings-to-growth ratio (PEG) of 1. PEGs below 1 are generally considered undervalued, although growth stocks will often have PEGs well above 1.Nvidia\\'s growth comes from a combination of the frantic buildout of artificial intelligence (AI) infrastructure and the wide moat the company has created through its CUDA software platform. Its graphics processing units (GPUs), which were originally created to speed up graphics rendering in video games, have become the backbone of AI infrastructure given their superior processing speeds.As large tech companies and AI start-ups rush to improve their AI models, they need more and more computing power to train them, which is largely coming from GPUs. Through Nvidia\\'s CUDA X collection of libraries, tools, and microservices, its semiconductors are easily programmable for various AI tasks, which has allowed it to take a nearly 90% market share in the GPU space.Elon Musk\\'s xAI is a great example of the growing use of GPUs in AI model training. The company used 20,000 GPUs to train its Grok 2 model, while it originally was using 100,000 GPUs to train its Grok 3 model, but then increased it to 200,000 for phase two of its training. Meanwhile, Musk has talked about xAI\\'s data center hosting a 1 million GPU cluster in the future.Story continuesMeanwhile, Nvidia\\'s largest customer, Microsoft, announced it will spend $80 billion on AI data centers this year. Not to be outdone, a consortium consisting of Oracle, SoftBank Group, and OpenAI has discussed spending up to $500 billion on AI infrastructure in Texas as part of the recently announced Project Stargate.A lot of this spending will undoubtedly go toward GPUs. These projects demonstrate the type of growth still ahead for Nvidia.Image source: Getty Images.2. AlphabetWhile no mega-cap company can come close to matching Nvidia\\'s recent growth, Alphabet is a strong growing company that has the cheapest valuation among the Magnificent Seven with a forward P/E of only 19.4.Last quarter, Alphabet grew its revenue a solid 15%, while its profits soared 34% and its earnings per share climbed 37%. The growth was led by its cloud computing division, Google Cloud, which grew its revenue by 35%.Cloud computing is a business with very high fixed costs that has a lot of operating leverage once the business reaches scale. That was seen in its last quarter, when the segment saw a profitability inflection point, with segment operating income surging from $266 million a year ago to $1.95 billion.With organizations scampering to build out their own AI models and applications, expect this business to continue to grow strongly as Alphabet adds more data center capacity. Meanwhile, the company could see even more operating leverage as it has developed its own custom AI chips with the help of Broadcom, which it has said in combination with GPUs is helping reduce AI inference processing times and lowering costs.As it continues to scale up as the smallest of the big-three cloud computing companies and with its custom chip advantage, Google Cloud\\'s margins should continue to improve, leading to strong earnings growth.At the same time, Alphabet owns the world\\'s dominant search engine in Google and YouTube, the most viewed streaming platform globally. These businesses continue to grow revenue by double digits, with sales for its overall Google Services segment climbing 13% last quarter. Segment operating income soared 29% to $30.9 billion.The company is looking to incorporate its new Gemini AI model throughout its businesses this year to help drive growth, while also looking to promote its Gemini app, which is its answer to ChatGPT.Management also has other emerging businesses that it is investing in, including quantum computing, where it recently announced a big technological breakthrough. It also owns Waymo, which is currently the only company offering paid robotaxi rides in the U.S. These are presently money-losing business, but they have big potential.Overall, Alphabet is a nice combination of growth and value with some solid longer-term optionality with its investments in robotaxis and quantum computing.Don’t miss this second chance at a potentially lucrative opportunityEver feel like you missed the boat in buying the most successful stocks?

The answer was a shockingly low $3,625 at the time I crunched the numbers. Because Nvidia\\'s shares have risen over the last few days, the magic amount is even lower now.In my backward-looking exercise, I also examined what signs might have pointed to Nvidia\\'s potential for massive gains. And there were some good indications about the company\\'s prospects for anyone looking closely.But what about Nvidia\\'s prospects now? Where will the company and its stock be in 10 years? I won\\'t pretend to have any definitive answers. However, I\\'ll take a stab at where I think Nvidia will be in 2035.A prediction of Nvidia\\'s futureThe most important assumption I have about Nvidia\\'s future is that we\\'ve only seen the tip of the iceberg with how artificial intelligence (AI) will impact the world. I suspect more of the iceberg will be visible relatively soon, though, with the adoption of AI agents that can perform tasks autonomously.Could artificial general intelligence (AGI) be achieved within the next 10 years? Probably, depending on how you define AGI. I agree with Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang that AI models will be able to pass any test that humans can in five years or less. I wouldn\\'t go as far as predicting AI systems will be sentient (a criterion some have for AGI) by 2035, though.I fully expect Nvidia to remain a central player in AI over the next decade and beyond. The company\\'s new Blackwell GPU architecture -- which has the most powerful AI capabilities to date -- will likely seem painfully slow and unwieldy compared to what Nvidia will roll out 10 years from now.My future picture of Nvidia includes the company aggressively expanding into areas such as developing custom AI chips. I also think the autonomous ride-hailing market (robotaxis) will explode over the next few years, with Nvidia as one of the top beneficiaries.While AI is Nvidia\\'s biggest opportunity, in my opinion, I believe the company will also see tremendous growth thanks to the adoption of augmented reality (AR) and virtual reality (VR). AR and VR applications will require powerful graphics processors -- and no company is better at it than Nvidia.What could go wrong?Murphy\\'s Law can affect even the best companies. What could go wrong and derail my admittedly upbeat prediction about Nvidia\\'s future? Several things.Competition in the AI chip market will almost certainly increase significantly over the next 10 years. I expect Advanced Micro Devices will further step up its game. I\\'ll also keep my eyes on Nvidia\\'s big customers who have developed their own AI chips, including Google parent Alphabet, Amazon, and Microsoft.Story continuesPerhaps the most worrisome competition, though, could come from major technological breakthroughs by rivals. Nvidia\\'s Huang caused quantum computing stocks to plunge recently with his comments that practical quantum computers are probably 15 to 30 years away. That could be wishful thinking. I can envision a scenario where another company develops a quantum computer that\\'s more powerful for training and deploying AI models than Nvidia\\'s GPUs.As successful as it is (and I think will continue to be), Nvidia isn\\'t immune to macroeconomic factors. If the global economy enters into a deep, prolonged recession, the chipmaker might not grow nearly as much as I expect it will.I\\'d also be remiss without acknowledging that my optimism about the future of AI could be too pie in the sky. Maybe large language models (LLMs) could hit a performance plateau, with no better technologies emerging.The multitrillion-dollar questionSo far, I\\'ve only addressed where I think Nvidia\\'s business will be in 2035. But the multitrillion-dollar question is: Where will Nvidia stock be in 10 years?Before I attempt to answer this question, I\\'ll tell you what I don\\'t think will happen. Over the last 10 years, Nvidia\\'s share price has skyrocketed nearly 285 times higher. I don\\'t see the stock delivering anywhere near that kind of return over the next decade.However, as mentioned, I foresee major growth opportunities for Nvidia over the next 10 years in AI, robotaxis, and AR/VR. Could Nvidia\\'s compound annual growth rate (CAGR) be at least 15% during this period? I think it\\'s possible. If we assume a 15% CAGR, the stock would be a four-bagger by 2035, with a market cap of over $18 trillion.Admittedly, this prediction could be way too optimistic. But even if Nvidia delivers a much lower CAGR of 8%, its stock would more than double over the next decade and give the company a market cap of more than $11 trillion. Unless an unforeseen threat emerges that takes the wind out of Nvidia\\'s sails, the GPU maker\\'s future appears to be very bright.Don’t miss this second chance at a potentially lucrative opportunityEver feel like you missed the boat in buying the most successful stocks?

The semiconductor company is the leading seller of computer chips for artificial intelligence (AI) data centers, which are getting a huge boost in demand. Nvidia\\'s revenue and profits have soared in the last few years, with investors getting uber-bullish on the stock. As of this writing, Nvidia has a market cap of $3.46 trillion, making it the largest company in the world by market value.I think 2025 will be the year the Empire strikes back, with the rest of big tech regaining a negotiating foothold as semiconductor supply chains catch up with demand for AI products. Who will that benefit the most? My bet is Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN), the largest cloud computing company in the world, which is the backbone of many AI tools that are growing like gangbusters.Along with its dominant e-commerce operation, Amazon\\'s cloud computing division will allow it to finish 2025 with the largest market cap in the world. Here\\'s why.Steadily expanding profit marginsUnlike the rest of the big technology companies that already have sky-high profit margins, Amazon\\'s profitability is still vastly understated due to its propensity to invest for future growth. Last year, we started to see the company finally take its foot off the gas, a trend I think will continue in 2025.Over the last 12 months ending in September, Amazon posted an operating margin of 9.8%, a record high. Part of this is due to the Amazon Web Services (AWS) cloud computing segment, which had an operating margin of 35%. I expect AWS margins to remain strong, but the segment is still less than 20% of Amazon\\'s overall sales.Margin expansion is mainly coming from Amazon\\'s dominant North American e-commerce business, which posted an operating margin of 5.9% over the last 12 months. Still at a compressed level -- especially when you consider the tens of billions in high-margin third-party e-commerce fees, subscriptions, and advertising sales it brings in every year -- Amazon has plenty of room to bring segment profit margins even higher in 2025.While it won\\'t be an overnight story, Amazon can easily finish 2025 with a profit margin of 15% and most likely 20%, if it wants. The only question is how efficient its spending on research projects such as Alexa it will be.An artificial intelligence boom for the agesThere is a clear path to Amazon expanding its profit margins in 2025. There is also reason to believe it will keep accelerating revenue growth, especially at AWS.AWS\\'s net sales growth went from 12% in Q3 a year ago to 19% year-over-year growth last quarter. The boom in AI spending should continue in 2025, with capital expenditure budgets seemingly going up every day. This is a good thing for AWS, as more capital expenditures mean more demand for AI computing power, which means more revenue for AWS. In fact, famous investor Softbank announced it will be investing $100 billion in AI in the United States.\\xa0While all of this will not be spent on AWS data centers, the trend is here to stay.Story continuesIf AWS can grow its revenue by 30% over the next 12 months as more and more AI demand gets fulfilled, the division will reach $134 billion in sales and help accelerate Amazon\\'s consolidated revenue growth.NVDA Operating Income (TTM) data by YCharts.Why Amazon can finish 2025 as the largest company in the worldMy belief in Amazon finishing 2025 as the largest company in the world largely rests on an acceleration in revenue growth at AWS and consolidated profit margin expansion. Here\\'s the math that shows why this could occur.Amazon\\'s trailing 12-month revenue is $620 billion, with sales growing 11% year-over-year last quarter. If revenue growth can accelerate to 15% over the next 12 months, that will bring annual sales to $713 billion. It is a staggering size but shows the massive markets Amazon is going after in e-commerce, retail, and cloud computing.As I discussed above, there is room for Amazon to expand its operating margin to close to 20% in 2025. While I\\'m not confident it will hit exactly 20%, there should be high conviction in the general direction of this metric in 2025. If Amazon stopped investing in research projects, the company would likely have profit margins even higher than 20%.The 20% profit margins on $713 billion in revenue equals $142.6 billion in operating income. This is above the operating income generated by Nvidia, Apple, and Microsoft over the last 12 months. While not a guarantee, I think the company that generates the highest profit should have the largest market cap in the world, especially one with promising growth prospects such as Amazon. For this reason, I think Amazon will finish 2025 as the stock with the largest market cap in the world, making it a buy for your portfolio right now.Don’t miss this second chance at a potentially lucrative opportunityEver feel like you missed the boat in buying the most successful stocks?

Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) posted the biggest gain in the Dow Jones Industrial Average, and Palantir Technologies (NASDAQ: PLTR) delivered the top performance in the S&P 500. These players surged 171% and 340%, respectively.Why did investors pile into these stocks? Both have benefited from the artificial intelligence (AI) boom. Nvidia dominates the AI chip market, while Palantir uses AI as a key part of its software-as-a-service platform. As a result, revenue at both companies is soaring.After these successes, you may think it\\'s too late to get in on these top AI players. But we\\'re actually in the early days of the AI growth story, and these companies are well positioned to benefit through the next chapters. Let\\'s take a closer look at these two red-hot growth stocks that remain buys in 2025.Image source: Getty Images.1. NvidiaFirst, some background on this AI giant. Nvidia wasn\\'t always linked to AI. In its earlier days, it was known for its work with the video games industry. The company\\'s graphics processing units (GPUs) drove the lively images key to a great game (and they still do). But it soon became clear that GPUs could be useful in many other industries -- so Nvidia developed the CUDA parallel computing platform to make this a reality.Today, Nvidia serves various industries -- from healthcare to automobiles -- and its main focus is on AI. The data center business makes up the lion\\'s share of revenue, and it looks as if there\\'s a lot more growth to come. Here\\'s why. Nvidia will continue to benefit from the ongoing buildout of AI infrastructure, supplying GPUs and other products. For example, the U.S. just announced a new $500 billion AI infrastructure project and named Nvidia a key technology partner.On top of this, Nvidia is set to gain from the next wave of AI growth: applying AI to real-world situations. Agentic AI -- the use of AI agents to consider problems, reason, and apply solutions -- is a big part of that, and Nvidia has already taken steps here. The company offers blueprints for customers to design their own AI agents.So, today, trading for 49 times forward earnings estimates, Nvidia looks reasonably priced and makes a great growth buy for 2025 and beyond.2. Palantir TechnologiesTwenty-year-old Palantir was once known for its contracts with governments, its biggest customer group. But recently, a new growth driver has emerged: the commercial customer. Palantir sells software that aggregates a customer\\'s data and helps leverage that data to make often game-changing decisions.Story continuesThe company launched a new product, its Artificial Intelligence Platform (AIP), a little more than a year ago, and it\\'s helped this transition happen. AIP integrates AI into the data collection and decision-making processes. Palantir\\'s commercial customers,\\xa0totaling 14 just four years ago, have increased to about 300 -- concrete evidence that AIP is driving growth at Palantir.In even more good news, government revenue continues to increase, too, showing that the company now has two strong growth drivers. In the recent quarter, government and commercial revenue each climbed in the double digits, and Palantir reached its biggest profit ever.AIP is still a relatively new product, and the number of commercial customers today leaves plenty of room for growth. In addition, as mentioned, AI is still in its early stages of growth. Today\\'s $200 billion AI market may surpass $1 trillion by the end of the decade.And though Palantir looks expensive in relation to forward earnings estimates -- its forward price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio is 165 -- a metric that considers growth tells a different story. Palantir\\'s forward price/earnings-to-growth (PEG) ratio of 0.3 is reasonable, considering ratios of more than 1 suggest a stock is overvalued.\\xa0All of this means Palantir remains a solid buy for growth investors in 2025.Should you invest $1,000 in Nvidia right now?Before you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\\xa010 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Nvidia wasn’t one of them.

And the company claims one of its models only cost $5.6 million to train, compared to the hundreds of millions of dollars that leading American companies pay to train theirs.It also seems to have achieved that in the face of U.S. sanctions that prohibit the sale of advanced chips to Chinese companies. The MIT Technology Review writes that the company’s success illustrates how sanctions are “driving startups like DeepSeek to innovate in ways that prioritize efficiency, resource-pooling, and collaboration.” (On the other hand, the Wall Street Journal reports that DeepSeek’s Liang Wenfeng recently told China’s premier that American export restrictions still pose a bottleneck.)Curai CEO Neal Khosla offered a simpler explanation, claiming that the company is a “ccp state psyop” that\\'s “faking the cost was low to justify setting price low and hoping everyone switches to it [to] damage AI competitiveness in the us.” (A Community Note has been attached to his post pointing out that Khosla offers no evidence for this, and that his father Vinod is an OpenAI investor.)Meanwhile, journalist Holger Zschaepitz suggested DeepSeek “could represent the biggest threat to US equity markets” — if a Chinese company can build a cutting-edge model at low cost, without access to advanced chips, it would call into question “the utility of the hundreds of billions worth of capex being poured into this industry.”In response, Y Combinator CEO Garry Tan argued DeepSeek\\'s success would actually be good for its American competitors. “If training models get cheaper faster and easier,\" he wrote on X, \"the demand for inference (actual real world use of AI) will grow and accelerate even faster, which assures the supply of compute will be used.\"And Meta’s Chief AI Scientist Yann LeCun argued against looking at DeepSeek’s announcement through the lens of China versus the United States. Instead, he suggested the real lesson is that “open source models are surpassing proprietary ones.”“DeepSeek has profited from open research and open source (e.g. PyTorch and Llama from Meta),” LeCun wrote on LinkedIn this week. “They came up with new ideas and built them on top of other people\\'s work. Because their work is published and open source, everyone can profit from it.”Story continuesAll of the debate seems to be driving consumers to try the product.

A big week for world markets kicks off in Asia on Monday with investors still navigating the blizzard of headlines around U.S. President Donald Trump\\'s likely economic agenda, while trying to gauge whether the \"U.S. exceptionalism\" narrative may be losing its luster.    The dollar fell 1.8% last week, its worst week since November 2023. If the greenback is consolidating, it shouldn\\'t really be a surprise - it hit a two-year high earlier this month and hedge fund net \\'long\\' position was the biggest in nine years. The dollar and U.S. stocks have been closely correlated, lifted by the huge wave of global capital inflows as investors bet heavily on the American AI, tech, growth and returns boom. But if the dollar\\'s slide is a sign that the \"U.S. exceptionalism\" flame is starting to flicker, is Wall Street primed for a cooling off period too? The S&P 500 hit a new high last week and the Nasdaq came close. Index levels are historically high, valuations are stretched, and big event risk looms this week in the shape of the Fed\\'s policy meeting and \\'Big Tech\\' earnings. Scrutiny on U.S. tech is intensifying as ripples from a Chinese AI startup called DeepSeek spread. DeepSeek recently launched a free, open-source AI model it claims is at least the equal of more established models like ChatGPT on many levels, but built at a fraction of the cost.    It\\'s early days but if this shines a critical light on the huge sums being spent on AI by U.S. tech firms, Wall Street could wobble. The Asian calendar on Monday is dominated by China\\'s \\'official\\' manufacturing and service sector purchasing managers index reports for January. A Reuters poll suggests the manufacturing PMI will be unchanged from the previous month at 50.1. On the one hand, that would represent the fourth straight month of expansion in the sector. It would also indicate almost no growth at all for the second month in a row. Data on Friday showed Chinese state-owned firms\\' profits last year virtually evaporated, rising only 0.4% on the previous year. Wider industrial sector profits figures are due this week, perhaps as early as Monday, and are expected to confirm that 2024 was the worst year in decades. Investors will give their second day verdict on Friday\\'s Bank of Japan\\'s rate hike. The initial take seemed to be that it was a \\'hawkish hike\\', but Japanese money markets are still pricing in only another 25 basis points of tightening this year, unchanged from pre-Friday levels. This suggests BOJ guidance was actually pretty neutral, and Japanese stock futures are pointing to a strong rise on Monday.  Story Continues    Meanwhile, South Korean markets will be sensitive to the news that prosecutors on Sunday indicted impeached President Yoon Suk Yeol on charges of leading an insurrection with his short-lived imposition of martial law on Dec. 3.

In this article, we are going to take a look at where Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Limited (NYSE:TSM) stands against other top AI news you shouldn’t miss. All everyone could talk about in the technical AI landscape these days is DeepSeek-R1, a Chinese open-source LLM that analysts believe can give major American AI companies a run for their money. Why is DeepSeek making waves and why is it called a breakthrough in the AI race?    DeepSeek AI model is several times cheaper to use for professional purposes when compared to its American counterparts including OpenAI’s o1 model. Media reports also suggest the model beat almost all key AI models in the industry by significant margins. CNBC’s Deirdre Bosa explained what makes these Chinese models a challenge for US tech companies: “The cost, I mean, these models coming out of China are just built at a fraction of the price when you think about OpenAI. That’s spending $5 billion a year, burning through billions of dollars a year. These models, the DeepSeek for example, they say they built it for less than $6 million. ByteDance as well, you know, shows that it was built and you can access it at much, much lower prices. So, this really turns on sort of this truth that we have thought about generative AI for the last few years—that you need hundreds of millions of dollars to develop bigger and better models. What the Chinese labs and companies are doing is they’re going straight to the frontier. They’re building with sort of infrastructure and outputs that are already out there, built in many cases by American companies and startups, and they’re improving on it, they’re innovating on it, and producing models that are just as good, in some cases, at a fraction of the cost.”  READ ALSO: 7 Best Stocks to Buy For Long-Term\\xa0and\\xa08 Cheap Jim Cramer Stocks to Invest In For this article, we picked 10 AI stocks currently in the news. With each company we have mentioned the number of hedge fund investors. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points\\xa0(see more details here).   Is Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Limited (TSM) Among Billionaire Dan Loeb’s Top Stock Picks?   A close-up of a complex network of integrated circuits used in logic semiconductors. Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Limited (NYSE:TSM) Number of Hedge Fund Investors: 158 Evercore ISI recently said the market is expected to experience more of what it saw in 2024, with the investment firm expressing a positive outlook for Information Technology in 2025, calling it “Fill IT up again.”  Story Continues    The firm emphasized that “the bull market in the S&P remains strong” and expects “another 22% upside to 7,200 in 2025.” Currently, the benchmark index stands at 5,940 as the new year begins. Backing its optimistic view is the Information Technology sector, with Evercore ISI predicting tech will once again lead the market higher. Within the sector, both semiconductors and software were highlighted. On Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Limited (NYSE:TSM), the firm stated, “semis are coiled for a major move higher,” pointing to high-conviction positions including Broadcom. ClearBridge All Cap Growth Strategy stated the following regarding Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Limited (NYSE:TSM) in its\\xa0Q3 2024 investor letter: “While the Strategy continues to have a significant position in Nvidia, we are underweight semiconductors versus the benchmark. We added to our semiconductor positioning during the quarter with the purchase of\\xa0Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Limited\\xa0(NYSE:TSM). TSM, an out-of-benchmark name, is the world’s fabrication production provider of choice. The criticality and sophistication of its manufacturing footprint powers all of the leading edge fabless global semiconductor companies, including Apple, Nvidia, Qualcomm, AMD and Broadcom. While AI has driven upside in data centers, PCs and handsets are at cycle lows, positioning half of the company’s business for a recovery.”  Overall, TSM ranks 2nd on our list of top AI news you shouldn’t miss. While we acknowledge the potential of TSM, our conviction lies in the belief that under the radar AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter time frame. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than TSM but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the\\xa0cheapest AI stock.

In this article, we are going to take a look at where Palantir Technologies Inc. (NASDAQ:PLTR) stands against other top AI news you shouldn’t miss. All everyone could talk about in the technical AI landscape these days is DeepSeek-R1, a Chinese open-source LLM that analysts believe can give major American AI companies a run for their money. Why is DeepSeek making waves and why is it called a breakthrough in the AI race?    DeepSeek AI model is several times cheaper to use for professional purposes when compared to its American counterparts including OpenAI’s o1 model. Media reports also suggest the model beat almost all key AI models in the industry by significant margins. CNBC’s Deirdre Bosa explained what makes these Chinese models a challenge for US tech companies: “The cost, I mean, these models coming out of China are just built at a fraction of the price when you think about OpenAI.

ByteDance as well, you know, shows that it was built and you can access it at much, much lower prices. So, this really turns on sort of this truth that we have thought about generative AI for the last few years—that you need hundreds of millions of dollars to develop bigger and better models. What the Chinese labs and companies are doing is they’re going straight to the frontier. They’re building with sort of infrastructure and outputs that are already out there, built in many cases by American companies and startups, and they’re improving on it, they’re innovating on it, and producing models that are just as good, in some cases, at a fraction of the cost.”  READ ALSO: 7 Best Stocks to Buy For Long-Term\\xa0and\\xa08 Cheap Jim Cramer Stocks to Invest In For this article, we picked 10 AI stocks currently in the news.

Jim Cramer Says He Is Now a ‘Believer’ in Palantir Technologies (PLTR) CEO Alex Karp   everything possible/Shutterstock.com Palantir Technologies Inc. (NASDAQ:PLTR) Number of Hedge Fund Investors: 43 Jim Cramer in a recent program on CNBC praised Palantir Technologies Inc. (NASDAQ:PLTR) and its management and said the stock may turn out to be undervalued in the long term because of its growth.  Story Continues    “I have growing respect for what the company’s trying to do, and I think that even though it seems 100 times earnings, it may turn out to be much less in terms of the multiple. It is the highest—got the highest so-called rule of 40 about its growth and margins of any company. My hats off to these guys. If you go back and read the last couple of analyst reports, it really is the exciting AI company of our era.”  Cramer also appreciated Palantir Technologies (NASDAQ:PLTR) CEO Alex Karp: “I think what really is, this is a very, very high-growth company, and we really don’t know how to value it. We don’t know how to value it because Alex Karp, the CEO, is basically saying, “Listen, our valuation is confused. We’re the fastest growing, but we’re not really going to tell you everything that we do.” I am a believer in Alex Karp. I ordered his book, I’ve read a lot, I’ve seen his videos, and I think that what he’s got here is something that is much more special.”  ClearBridge Growth Strategy stated the following regarding Palantir Technologies Inc. (NASDAQ:PLTR) in its\\xa0Q4 2024 investor letter: “To promote balance, manage risk and augment the portfolio’s growth characteristics, we continued to take profits in some of our more established, larger holdings to seed new purchases. We believe that the arms race and value unlock from AI will provide a multiyear tailwind to a number of companies in our coverage.

And the company claims one of its models only cost $5.6 million to train, compared to the hundreds of millions of dollars that leading American companies pay to train theirs.It also seems to have achieved that in the face of U.S. sanctions that prohibit the sale of advanced chips to Chinese companies. The MIT Technology Review writes that the company’s success illustrates how sanctions are “driving startups like DeepSeek to innovate in ways that prioritize efficiency, resource-pooling, and collaboration.” (On the other hand, the Wall Street Journal reports that DeepSeek’s Liang Wenfeng recently told China’s premier that American export restrictions still pose a bottleneck.)Curai CEO Neal Khosla offered a simpler explanation, claiming that the company is a “ccp state psyop” that\\'s “faking the cost was low to justify setting price low and hoping everyone switches to it [to] damage AI competitiveness in the us.” (A Community Note has been attached to his post pointing out that Khosla offers no evidence for this, and that his father Vinod is an OpenAI investor.)Meanwhile, journalist Holger Zschaepitz suggested DeepSeek “could represent the biggest threat to US equity markets” — if a Chinese company can build a cutting-edge model at low cost, without access to advanced chips, it would call into question “the utility of the hundreds of billions worth of capex being poured into this industry.”In response, Y Combinator CEO Garry Tan argued DeepSeek\\'s success would actually be good for its American competitors. “If training models get cheaper faster and easier,\" he wrote on X, \"the demand for inference (actual real world use of AI) will grow and accelerate even faster, which assures the supply of compute will be used.\"And Meta’s Chief AI Scientist Yann LeCun argued against looking at DeepSeek’s announcement through the lens of China versus the United States. Instead, he suggested the real lesson is that “open source models are surpassing proprietary ones.”“DeepSeek has profited from open research and open source (e.g. PyTorch and Llama from Meta),” LeCun wrote on LinkedIn this week. “They came up with new ideas and built them on top of other people\\'s work. Because their work is published and open source, everyone can profit from it.”Story continuesAll of the debate seems to be driving consumers to try the product. As of Sunday afternoon, DeepSeek\\'s AI assistant is the top free app in the Apple App Store, just ahead of ChatGPT.This article originally appeared on TechCrunch at https://techcrunch.com/2025/01/26/deepseek-gets-silicon-valley-talking/View commentsAdvertisement     Copyright © 2025 Yahoo.

A big week for world markets kicks off in Asia on Monday with investors still navigating the blizzard of headlines around U.S. President Donald Trump\\'s likely economic agenda, while trying to gauge whether the \"U.S. exceptionalism\" narrative may be losing its luster.    The dollar fell 1.8% last week, its worst week since November 2023. If the greenback is consolidating, it shouldn\\'t really be a surprise - it hit a two-year high earlier this month and hedge fund net \\'long\\' position was the biggest in nine years. The dollar and U.S. stocks have been closely correlated, lifted by the huge wave of global capital inflows as investors bet heavily on the American AI, tech, growth and returns boom. But if the dollar\\'s slide is a sign that the \"U.S. exceptionalism\" flame is starting to flicker, is Wall Street primed for a cooling off period too? The S&P 500 hit a new high last week and the Nasdaq came close. Index levels are historically high, valuations are stretched, and big event risk looms this week in the shape of the Fed\\'s policy meeting and \\'Big Tech\\' earnings. Scrutiny on U.S. tech is intensifying as ripples from a Chinese AI startup called DeepSeek spread. DeepSeek recently launched a free, open-source AI model it claims is at least the equal of more established models like ChatGPT on many levels, but built at a fraction of the cost.    It\\'s early days but if this shines a critical light on the huge sums being spent on AI by U.S. tech firms, Wall Street could wobble. The Asian calendar on Monday is dominated by China\\'s \\'official\\' manufacturing and service sector purchasing managers index reports for January. A Reuters poll suggests the manufacturing PMI will be unchanged from the previous month at 50.1. On the one hand, that would represent the fourth straight month of expansion in the sector. It would also indicate almost no growth at all for the second month in a row. Data on Friday showed Chinese state-owned firms\\' profits last year virtually evaporated, rising only 0.4% on the previous year. Wider industrial sector profits figures are due this week, perhaps as early as Monday, and are expected to confirm that 2024 was the worst year in decades. Investors will give their second day verdict on Friday\\'s Bank of Japan\\'s rate hike. The initial take seemed to be that it was a \\'hawkish hike\\', but Japanese money markets are still pricing in only another 25 basis points of tightening this year, unchanged from pre-Friday levels. This suggests BOJ guidance was actually pretty neutral, and Japanese stock futures are pointing to a strong rise on Monday.  Story Continues    Meanwhile, South Korean markets will be sensitive to the news that prosecutors on Sunday indicted impeached President Yoon Suk Yeol on charges of leading an insurrection with his short-lived imposition of martial law on Dec. 3. Here are key developments that could provide more direction to markets on Friday: - China \\'official\\' PMIs (January) - Japan leading indicator (November) - Germany Ifo index (January) (Reporting by Jamie McGeever; Editing by Diane Craft)  Terms   and Privacy Policy   Your Privacy Choices           Recommended Stories        Copyright © 2025 Yahoo.

Is Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Limited (TSM) Among Billionaire Dan Loeb’s Top Stock Picks?   A close-up of a complex network of integrated circuits used in logic semiconductors. Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Limited (NYSE:TSM) Number of Hedge Fund Investors: 158 Evercore ISI recently said the market is expected to experience more of what it saw in 2024, with the investment firm expressing a positive outlook for Information Technology in 2025, calling it “Fill IT up again.”  Story Continues    The firm emphasized that “the bull market in the S&P remains strong” and expects “another 22% upside to 7,200 in 2025.” Currently, the benchmark index stands at 5,940 as the new year begins. Backing its optimistic view is the Information Technology sector, with Evercore ISI predicting tech will once again lead the market higher. Within the sector, both semiconductors and software were highlighted. On Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Limited (NYSE:TSM), the firm stated, “semis are coiled for a major move higher,” pointing to high-conviction positions including Broadcom. ClearBridge All Cap Growth Strategy stated the following regarding Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Limited (NYSE:TSM) in its\\xa0Q3 2024 investor letter: “While the Strategy continues to have a significant position in Nvidia, we are underweight semiconductors versus the benchmark. We added to our semiconductor positioning during the quarter with the purchase of\\xa0Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Limited\\xa0(NYSE:TSM). TSM, an out-of-benchmark name, is the world’s fabrication production provider of choice. The criticality and sophistication of its manufacturing footprint powers all of the leading edge fabless global semiconductor companies, including Apple, Nvidia, Qualcomm, AMD and Broadcom. While AI has driven upside in data centers, PCs and handsets are at cycle lows, positioning half of the company’s business for a recovery.”  Overall, TSM ranks 2nd on our list of top AI news you shouldn’t miss. While we acknowledge the potential of TSM, our conviction lies in the belief that under the radar AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter time frame.

Jim Cramer Says He Is Now a ‘Believer’ in Palantir Technologies (PLTR) CEO Alex Karp   everything possible/Shutterstock.com Palantir Technologies Inc. (NASDAQ:PLTR) Number of Hedge Fund Investors: 43 Jim Cramer in a recent program on CNBC praised Palantir Technologies Inc. (NASDAQ:PLTR) and its management and said the stock may turn out to be undervalued in the long term because of its growth.  Story Continues    “I have growing respect for what the company’s trying to do, and I think that even though it seems 100 times earnings, it may turn out to be much less in terms of the multiple. It is the highest—got the highest so-called rule of 40 about its growth and margins of any company. My hats off to these guys. If you go back and read the last couple of analyst reports, it really is the exciting AI company of our era.”  Cramer also appreciated Palantir Technologies (NASDAQ:PLTR) CEO Alex Karp: “I think what really is, this is a very, very high-growth company, and we really don’t know how to value it. We don’t know how to value it because Alex Karp, the CEO, is basically saying, “Listen, our valuation is confused. We’re the fastest growing, but we’re not really going to tell you everything that we do.” I am a believer in Alex Karp. I ordered his book, I’ve read a lot, I’ve seen his videos, and I think that what he’s got here is something that is much more special.”  ClearBridge Growth Strategy stated the following regarding Palantir Technologies Inc.

Are Both Stocks Buys?Geoffrey Seiler, The Motley FoolSun, Jan 26, 2025, 8:30 PM6 min readLink Copied0Analysts at Jefferies recently ranked the so-called \"Magnificent Seven\" stocks based on which ones they thought would outperform in 2025. The name refers to a group of leading mega-cap tech stocks that have been helping lead the market higher the past couple of years.Its top picks among the group were Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) and Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOGL) (NASDAQ: GOOG). The group also includes, by order of Jefferies\\' rankings, Meta Platforms, Apple, Amazon, Tesla, and Microsoft.The firm\\'s rankings were based on several quantitative measures, including growth, valuation, yield, earnings revisions, sell-side analyst sentiment, return on invested capital (ROIC), stock price momentum, and research and development (R&D) versus capex (capital expenditures) spending.Nvidia grabbed the top spot largely due to its strong growth, upward guidance revisions, attractive valuation, and strong analyst sentiment.Let\\'s look at why I think both Nvidia and Alphabet stocks are attractive buys.1. NvidiaNvidia remains a great combination of incredibly strong growth at an attractive valuation. The company is on pace to report its second consecutive year of triple-digit revenue increases, which given its size is quite remarkable.Meanwhile, analysts are projecting more than 50% sales growth in 2025. And it is attractively valued with a forward price-to-earnings ratio (P/E) below 33 times and a price/earnings-to-growth ratio (PEG) of 1. PEGs below 1 are generally considered undervalued, although growth stocks will often have PEGs well above 1.Nvidia\\'s growth comes from a combination of the frantic buildout of artificial intelligence (AI) infrastructure and the wide moat the company has created through its CUDA software platform. Its graphics processing units (GPUs), which were originally created to speed up graphics rendering in video games, have become the backbone of AI infrastructure given their superior processing speeds.As large tech companies and AI start-ups rush to improve their AI models, they need more and more computing power to train them, which is largely coming from GPUs. Through Nvidia\\'s CUDA X collection of libraries, tools, and microservices, its semiconductors are easily programmable for various AI tasks, which has allowed it to take a nearly 90% market share in the GPU space.Elon Musk\\'s xAI is a great example of the growing use of GPUs in AI model training. The company used 20,000 GPUs to train its Grok 2 model, while it originally was using 100,000 GPUs to train its Grok 3 model, but then increased it to 200,000 for phase two of its training. Meanwhile, Musk has talked about xAI\\'s data center hosting a 1 million GPU cluster in the future.Story continuesMeanwhile, Nvidia\\'s largest customer, Microsoft, announced it will spend $80 billion on AI data centers this year. Not to be outdone, a consortium consisting of Oracle, SoftBank Group, and OpenAI has discussed spending up to $500 billion on AI infrastructure in Texas as part of the recently announced Project Stargate.A lot of this spending will undoubtedly go toward GPUs. These projects demonstrate the type of growth still ahead for Nvidia.Image source: Getty Images.2. AlphabetWhile no mega-cap company can come close to matching Nvidia\\'s recent growth, Alphabet is a strong growing company that has the cheapest valuation among the Magnificent Seven with a forward P/E of only 19.4.Last quarter, Alphabet grew its revenue a solid 15%, while its profits soared 34% and its earnings per share climbed 37%. The growth was led by its cloud computing division, Google Cloud, which grew its revenue by 35%.Cloud computing is a business with very high fixed costs that has a lot of operating leverage once the business reaches scale. That was seen in its last quarter, when the segment saw a profitability inflection point, with segment operating income surging from $266 million a year ago to $1.95 billion.With organizations scampering to build out their own AI models and applications, expect this business to continue to grow strongly as Alphabet adds more data center capacity. Meanwhile, the company could see even more operating leverage as it has developed its own custom AI chips with the help of Broadcom, which it has said in combination with GPUs is helping reduce AI inference processing times and lowering costs.As it continues to scale up as the smallest of the big-three cloud computing companies and with its custom chip advantage, Google Cloud\\'s margins should continue to improve, leading to strong earnings growth.At the same time, Alphabet owns the world\\'s dominant search engine in Google and YouTube, the most viewed streaming platform globally. These businesses continue to grow revenue by double digits, with sales for its overall Google Services segment climbing 13% last quarter. Segment operating income soared 29% to $30.9 billion.The company is looking to incorporate its new Gemini AI model throughout its businesses this year to help drive growth, while also looking to promote its Gemini app, which is its answer to ChatGPT.Management also has other emerging businesses that it is investing in, including quantum computing, where it recently announced a big technological breakthrough. It also owns Waymo, which is currently the only company offering paid robotaxi rides in the U.S. These are presently money-losing business, but they have big potential.Overall, Alphabet is a nice combination of growth and value with some solid longer-term optionality with its investments in robotaxis and quantum computing.Don’t miss this second chance at a potentially lucrative opportunityEver feel like you missed the boat in buying the most successful stocks?

The answer was a shockingly low $3,625 at the time I crunched the numbers. Because Nvidia\\'s shares have risen over the last few days, the magic amount is even lower now.In my backward-looking exercise, I also examined what signs might have pointed to Nvidia\\'s potential for massive gains. And there were some good indications about the company\\'s prospects for anyone looking closely.But what about Nvidia\\'s prospects now? Where will the company and its stock be in 10 years? I won\\'t pretend to have any definitive answers. However, I\\'ll take a stab at where I think Nvidia will be in 2035.A prediction of Nvidia\\'s futureThe most important assumption I have about Nvidia\\'s future is that we\\'ve only seen the tip of the iceberg with how artificial intelligence (AI) will impact the world. I suspect more of the iceberg will be visible relatively soon, though, with the adoption of AI agents that can perform tasks autonomously.Could artificial general intelligence (AGI) be achieved within the next 10 years? Probably, depending on how you define AGI. I agree with Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang that AI models will be able to pass any test that humans can in five years or less. I wouldn\\'t go as far as predicting AI systems will be sentient (a criterion some have for AGI) by 2035, though.I fully expect Nvidia to remain a central player in AI over the next decade and beyond. The company\\'s new Blackwell GPU architecture -- which has the most powerful AI capabilities to date -- will likely seem painfully slow and unwieldy compared to what Nvidia will roll out 10 years from now.My future picture of Nvidia includes the company aggressively expanding into areas such as developing custom AI chips. I also think the autonomous ride-hailing market (robotaxis) will explode over the next few years, with Nvidia as one of the top beneficiaries.While AI is Nvidia\\'s biggest opportunity, in my opinion, I believe the company will also see tremendous growth thanks to the adoption of augmented reality (AR) and virtual reality (VR). AR and VR applications will require powerful graphics processors -- and no company is better at it than Nvidia.What could go wrong?Murphy\\'s Law can affect even the best companies. What could go wrong and derail my admittedly upbeat prediction about Nvidia\\'s future? Several things.Competition in the AI chip market will almost certainly increase significantly over the next 10 years. I expect Advanced Micro Devices will further step up its game. I\\'ll also keep my eyes on Nvidia\\'s big customers who have developed their own AI chips, including Google parent Alphabet, Amazon, and Microsoft.Story continuesPerhaps the most worrisome competition, though, could come from major technological breakthroughs by rivals. Nvidia\\'s Huang caused quantum computing stocks to plunge recently with his comments that practical quantum computers are probably 15 to 30 years away. That could be wishful thinking. I can envision a scenario where another company develops a quantum computer that\\'s more powerful for training and deploying AI models than Nvidia\\'s GPUs.As successful as it is (and I think will continue to be), Nvidia isn\\'t immune to macroeconomic factors. If the global economy enters into a deep, prolonged recession, the chipmaker might not grow nearly as much as I expect it will.I\\'d also be remiss without acknowledging that my optimism about the future of AI could be too pie in the sky. Maybe large language models (LLMs) could hit a performance plateau, with no better technologies emerging.The multitrillion-dollar questionSo far, I\\'ve only addressed where I think Nvidia\\'s business will be in 2035. But the multitrillion-dollar question is: Where will Nvidia stock be in 10 years?Before I attempt to answer this question, I\\'ll tell you what I don\\'t think will happen. Over the last 10 years, Nvidia\\'s share price has skyrocketed nearly 285 times higher. I don\\'t see the stock delivering anywhere near that kind of return over the next decade.However, as mentioned, I foresee major growth opportunities for Nvidia over the next 10 years in AI, robotaxis, and AR/VR. Could Nvidia\\'s compound annual growth rate (CAGR) be at least 15% during this period? I think it\\'s possible. If we assume a 15% CAGR, the stock would be a four-bagger by 2035, with a market cap of over $18 trillion.Admittedly, this prediction could be way too optimistic. But even if Nvidia delivers a much lower CAGR of 8%, its stock would more than double over the next decade and give the company a market cap of more than $11 trillion. Unless an unforeseen threat emerges that takes the wind out of Nvidia\\'s sails, the GPU maker\\'s future appears to be very bright.Don’t miss this second chance at a potentially lucrative opportunityEver feel like you missed the boat in buying the most successful stocks?

The semiconductor company is the leading seller of computer chips for artificial intelligence (AI) data centers, which are getting a huge boost in demand. Nvidia\\'s revenue and profits have soared in the last few years, with investors getting uber-bullish on the stock. As of this writing, Nvidia has a market cap of $3.46 trillion, making it the largest company in the world by market value.I think 2025 will be the year the Empire strikes back, with the rest of big tech regaining a negotiating foothold as semiconductor supply chains catch up with demand for AI products. Who will that benefit the most? My bet is Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN), the largest cloud computing company in the world, which is the backbone of many AI tools that are growing like gangbusters.Along with its dominant e-commerce operation, Amazon\\'s cloud computing division will allow it to finish 2025 with the largest market cap in the world. Here\\'s why.Steadily expanding profit marginsUnlike the rest of the big technology companies that already have sky-high profit margins, Amazon\\'s profitability is still vastly understated due to its propensity to invest for future growth. Last year, we started to see the company finally take its foot off the gas, a trend I think will continue in 2025.Over the last 12 months ending in September, Amazon posted an operating margin of 9.8%, a record high. Part of this is due to the Amazon Web Services (AWS) cloud computing segment, which had an operating margin of 35%. I expect AWS margins to remain strong, but the segment is still less than 20% of Amazon\\'s overall sales.Margin expansion is mainly coming from Amazon\\'s dominant North American e-commerce business, which posted an operating margin of 5.9% over the last 12 months. Still at a compressed level -- especially when you consider the tens of billions in high-margin third-party e-commerce fees, subscriptions, and advertising sales it brings in every year -- Amazon has plenty of room to bring segment profit margins even higher in 2025.While it won\\'t be an overnight story, Amazon can easily finish 2025 with a profit margin of 15% and most likely 20%, if it wants. The only question is how efficient its spending on research projects such as Alexa it will be.An artificial intelligence boom for the agesThere is a clear path to Amazon expanding its profit margins in 2025. There is also reason to believe it will keep accelerating revenue growth, especially at AWS.AWS\\'s net sales growth went from 12% in Q3 a year ago to 19% year-over-year growth last quarter. The boom in AI spending should continue in 2025, with capital expenditure budgets seemingly going up every day. This is a good thing for AWS, as more capital expenditures mean more demand for AI computing power, which means more revenue for AWS. In fact, famous investor Softbank announced it will be investing $100 billion in AI in the United States.\\xa0While all of this will not be spent on AWS data centers, the trend is here to stay.Story continuesIf AWS can grow its revenue by 30% over the next 12 months as more and more AI demand gets fulfilled, the division will reach $134 billion in sales and help accelerate Amazon\\'s consolidated revenue growth.NVDA Operating Income (TTM) data by YCharts.Why Amazon can finish 2025 as the largest company in the worldMy belief in Amazon finishing 2025 as the largest company in the world largely rests on an acceleration in revenue growth at AWS and consolidated profit margin expansion. Here\\'s the math that shows why this could occur.Amazon\\'s trailing 12-month revenue is $620 billion, with sales growing 11% year-over-year last quarter. If revenue growth can accelerate to 15% over the next 12 months, that will bring annual sales to $713 billion. It is a staggering size but shows the massive markets Amazon is going after in e-commerce, retail, and cloud computing.As I discussed above, there is room for Amazon to expand its operating margin to close to 20% in 2025. While I\\'m not confident it will hit exactly 20%, there should be high conviction in the general direction of this metric in 2025. If Amazon stopped investing in research projects, the company would likely have profit margins even higher than 20%.The 20% profit margins on $713 billion in revenue equals $142.6 billion in operating income. This is above the operating income generated by Nvidia, Apple, and Microsoft over the last 12 months. While not a guarantee, I think the company that generates the highest profit should have the largest market cap in the world, especially one with promising growth prospects such as Amazon. For this reason, I think Amazon will finish 2025 as the stock with the largest market cap in the world, making it a buy for your portfolio right now.Don’t miss this second chance at a potentially lucrative opportunityEver feel like you missed the boat in buying the most successful stocks?

Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) posted the biggest gain in the Dow Jones Industrial Average, and Palantir Technologies (NASDAQ: PLTR) delivered the top performance in the S&P 500. These players surged 171% and 340%, respectively.Why did investors pile into these stocks? Both have benefited from the artificial intelligence (AI) boom. Nvidia dominates the AI chip market, while Palantir uses AI as a key part of its software-as-a-service platform. As a result, revenue at both companies is soaring.After these successes, you may think it\\'s too late to get in on these top AI players. But we\\'re actually in the early days of the AI growth story, and these companies are well positioned to benefit through the next chapters. Let\\'s take a closer look at these two red-hot growth stocks that remain buys in 2025.Image source: Getty Images.1. NvidiaFirst, some background on this AI giant. Nvidia wasn\\'t always linked to AI. In its earlier days, it was known for its work with the video games industry. The company\\'s graphics processing units (GPUs) drove the lively images key to a great game (and they still do). But it soon became clear that GPUs could be useful in many other industries -- so Nvidia developed the CUDA parallel computing platform to make this a reality.Today, Nvidia serves various industries -- from healthcare to automobiles -- and its main focus is on AI. The data center business makes up the lion\\'s share of revenue, and it looks as if there\\'s a lot more growth to come. Here\\'s why. Nvidia will continue to benefit from the ongoing buildout of AI infrastructure, supplying GPUs and other products. For example, the U.S. just announced a new $500 billion AI infrastructure project and named Nvidia a key technology partner.On top of this, Nvidia is set to gain from the next wave of AI growth: applying AI to real-world situations. Agentic AI -- the use of AI agents to consider problems, reason, and apply solutions -- is a big part of that, and Nvidia has already taken steps here. The company offers blueprints for customers to design their own AI agents.So, today, trading for 49 times forward earnings estimates, Nvidia looks reasonably priced and makes a great growth buy for 2025 and beyond.2. Palantir TechnologiesTwenty-year-old Palantir was once known for its contracts with governments, its biggest customer group. But recently, a new growth driver has emerged: the commercial customer. Palantir sells software that aggregates a customer\\'s data and helps leverage that data to make often game-changing decisions.Story continuesThe company launched a new product, its Artificial Intelligence Platform (AIP), a little more than a year ago, and it\\'s helped this transition happen. AIP integrates AI into the data collection and decision-making processes. Palantir\\'s commercial customers,\\xa0totaling 14 just four years ago, have increased to about 300 -- concrete evidence that AIP is driving growth at Palantir.In even more good news, government revenue continues to increase, too, showing that the company now has two strong growth drivers. In the recent quarter, government and commercial revenue each climbed in the double digits, and Palantir reached its biggest profit ever.AIP is still a relatively new product, and the number of commercial customers today leaves plenty of room for growth. In addition, as mentioned, AI is still in its early stages of growth. Today\\'s $200 billion AI market may surpass $1 trillion by the end of the decade.And though Palantir looks expensive in relation to forward earnings estimates -- its forward price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio is 165 -- a metric that considers growth tells a different story. Palantir\\'s forward price/earnings-to-growth (PEG) ratio of 0.3 is reasonable, considering ratios of more than 1 suggest a stock is overvalued.\\xa0All of this means Palantir remains a solid buy for growth investors in 2025.Should you invest $1,000 in Nvidia right now?Before you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\\xa010 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Nvidia wasn’t one of them.

And the company claims one of its models only cost $5.6 million to train, compared to the hundreds of millions of dollars that leading American companies pay to train theirs.It also seems to have achieved that in the face of U.S. sanctions that prohibit the sale of advanced chips to Chinese companies. The MIT Technology Review writes that the company’s success illustrates how sanctions are “driving startups like DeepSeek to innovate in ways that prioritize efficiency, resource-pooling, and collaboration.” (On the other hand, the Wall Street Journal reports that DeepSeek’s Liang Wenfeng recently told China’s premier that American export restrictions still pose a bottleneck.)Curai CEO Neal Khosla offered a simpler explanation, claiming that the company is a “ccp state psyop” that\\'s “faking the cost was low to justify setting price low and hoping everyone switches to it [to] damage AI competitiveness in the us.” (A Community Note has been attached to his post pointing out that Khosla offers no evidence for this, and that his father Vinod is an OpenAI investor.)Meanwhile, journalist Holger Zschaepitz suggested DeepSeek “could represent the biggest threat to US equity markets” — if a Chinese company can build a cutting-edge model at low cost, without access to advanced chips, it would call into question “the utility of the hundreds of billions worth of capex being poured into this industry.”In response, Y Combinator CEO Garry Tan argued DeepSeek\\'s success would actually be good for its American competitors. “If training models get cheaper faster and easier,\" he wrote on X, \"the demand for inference (actual real world use of AI) will grow and accelerate even faster, which assures the supply of compute will be used.\"And Meta’s Chief AI Scientist Yann LeCun argued against looking at DeepSeek’s announcement through the lens of China versus the United States. Instead, he suggested the real lesson is that “open source models are surpassing proprietary ones.”“DeepSeek has profited from open research and open source (e.g. PyTorch and Llama from Meta),” LeCun wrote on LinkedIn this week. “They came up with new ideas and built them on top of other people\\'s work. Because their work is published and open source, everyone can profit from it.”Story continuesAll of the debate seems to be driving consumers to try the product. As of Sunday afternoon, DeepSeek\\'s AI assistant is the top free app in the Apple App Store, just ahead of ChatGPT.This article originally appeared on TechCrunch at https://techcrunch.com/2025/01/26/deepseek-gets-silicon-valley-talking/View commentsAdvertisement     Copyright © 2025 Yahoo.

A big week for world markets kicks off in Asia on Monday with investors still navigating the blizzard of headlines around U.S. President Donald Trump\\'s likely economic agenda, while trying to gauge whether the \"U.S. exceptionalism\" narrative may be losing its luster.    The dollar fell 1.8% last week, its worst week since November 2023. If the greenback is consolidating, it shouldn\\'t really be a surprise - it hit a two-year high earlier this month and hedge fund net \\'long\\' position was the biggest in nine years. The dollar and U.S. stocks have been closely correlated, lifted by the huge wave of global capital inflows as investors bet heavily on the American AI, tech, growth and returns boom. But if the dollar\\'s slide is a sign that the \"U.S. exceptionalism\" flame is starting to flicker, is Wall Street primed for a cooling off period too? The S&P 500 hit a new high last week and the Nasdaq came close. Index levels are historically high, valuations are stretched, and big event risk looms this week in the shape of the Fed\\'s policy meeting and \\'Big Tech\\' earnings. Scrutiny on U.S. tech is intensifying as ripples from a Chinese AI startup called DeepSeek spread. DeepSeek recently launched a free, open-source AI model it claims is at least the equal of more established models like ChatGPT on many levels, but built at a fraction of the cost.    It\\'s early days but if this shines a critical light on the huge sums being spent on AI by U.S. tech firms, Wall Street could wobble. The Asian calendar on Monday is dominated by China\\'s \\'official\\' manufacturing and service sector purchasing managers index reports for January. A Reuters poll suggests the manufacturing PMI will be unchanged from the previous month at 50.1. On the one hand, that would represent the fourth straight month of expansion in the sector. It would also indicate almost no growth at all for the second month in a row. Data on Friday showed Chinese state-owned firms\\' profits last year virtually evaporated, rising only 0.4% on the previous year. Wider industrial sector profits figures are due this week, perhaps as early as Monday, and are expected to confirm that 2024 was the worst year in decades. Investors will give their second day verdict on Friday\\'s Bank of Japan\\'s rate hike. The initial take seemed to be that it was a \\'hawkish hike\\', but Japanese money markets are still pricing in only another 25 basis points of tightening this year, unchanged from pre-Friday levels. This suggests BOJ guidance was actually pretty neutral, and Japanese stock futures are pointing to a strong rise on Monday.  Story Continues    Meanwhile, South Korean markets will be sensitive to the news that prosecutors on Sunday indicted impeached President Yoon Suk Yeol on charges of leading an insurrection with his short-lived imposition of martial law on Dec. 3. Here are key developments that could provide more direction to markets on Friday: - China \\'official\\' PMIs (January) - Japan leading indicator (November) - Germany Ifo index (January) (Reporting by Jamie McGeever; Editing by Diane Craft)  Terms   and Privacy Policy   Your Privacy Choices           Recommended Stories        Copyright © 2025 Yahoo.

In this article, we are going to take a look at where Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Limited (NYSE:TSM) stands against other top AI news you shouldn’t miss. All everyone could talk about in the technical AI landscape these days is DeepSeek-R1, a Chinese open-source LLM that analysts believe can give major American AI companies a run for their money. Why is DeepSeek making waves and why is it called a breakthrough in the AI race?    DeepSeek AI model is several times cheaper to use for professional purposes when compared to its American counterparts including OpenAI’s o1 model. Media reports also suggest the model beat almost all key AI models in the industry by significant margins. CNBC’s Deirdre Bosa explained what makes these Chinese models a challenge for US tech companies: “The cost, I mean, these models coming out of China are just built at a fraction of the price when you think about OpenAI. That’s spending $5 billion a year, burning through billions of dollars a year. These models, the DeepSeek for example, they say they built it for less than $6 million. ByteDance as well, you know, shows that it was built and you can access it at much, much lower prices. So, this really turns on sort of this truth that we have thought about generative AI for the last few years—that you need hundreds of millions of dollars to develop bigger and better models.

Is Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Limited (TSM) Among Billionaire Dan Loeb’s Top Stock Picks?   A close-up of a complex network of integrated circuits used in logic semiconductors. Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Limited (NYSE:TSM) Number of Hedge Fund Investors: 158 Evercore ISI recently said the market is expected to experience more of what it saw in 2024, with the investment firm expressing a positive outlook for Information Technology in 2025, calling it “Fill IT up again.”  Story Continues    The firm emphasized that “the bull market in the S&P remains strong” and expects “another 22% upside to 7,200 in 2025.” Currently, the benchmark index stands at 5,940 as the new year begins. Backing its optimistic view is the Information Technology sector, with Evercore ISI predicting tech will once again lead the market higher. Within the sector, both semiconductors and software were highlighted. On Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Limited (NYSE:TSM), the firm stated, “semis are coiled for a major move higher,” pointing to high-conviction positions including Broadcom. ClearBridge All Cap Growth Strategy stated the following regarding Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Limited (NYSE:TSM) in its\\xa0Q3 2024 investor letter: “While the Strategy continues to have a significant position in Nvidia, we are underweight semiconductors versus the benchmark. We added to our semiconductor positioning during the quarter with the purchase of\\xa0Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Limited\\xa0(NYSE:TSM). TSM, an out-of-benchmark name, is the world’s fabrication production provider of choice. The criticality and sophistication of its manufacturing footprint powers all of the leading edge fabless global semiconductor companies, including Apple, Nvidia, Qualcomm, AMD and Broadcom. While AI has driven upside in data centers, PCs and handsets are at cycle lows, positioning half of the company’s business for a recovery.”  Overall, TSM ranks 2nd on our list of top AI news you shouldn’t miss. While we acknowledge the potential of TSM, our conviction lies in the belief that under the radar AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter time frame. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than TSM but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the\\xa0cheapest AI stock.

In this article, we are going to take a look at where Palantir Technologies Inc. (NASDAQ:PLTR) stands against other top AI news you shouldn’t miss. All everyone could talk about in the technical AI landscape these days is DeepSeek-R1, a Chinese open-source LLM that analysts believe can give major American AI companies a run for their money. Why is DeepSeek making waves and why is it called a breakthrough in the AI race?    DeepSeek AI model is several times cheaper to use for professional purposes when compared to its American counterparts including OpenAI’s o1 model. Media reports also suggest the model beat almost all key AI models in the industry by significant margins. CNBC’s Deirdre Bosa explained what makes these Chinese models a challenge for US tech companies: “The cost, I mean, these models coming out of China are just built at a fraction of the price when you think about OpenAI. That’s spending $5 billion a year, burning through billions of dollars a year. These models, the DeepSeek for example, they say they built it for less than $6 million. ByteDance as well, you know, shows that it was built and you can access it at much, much lower prices. So, this really turns on sort of this truth that we have thought about generative AI for the last few years—that you need hundreds of millions of dollars to develop bigger and better models. What the Chinese labs and companies are doing is they’re going straight to the frontier. They’re building with sort of infrastructure and outputs that are already out there, built in many cases by American companies and startups, and they’re improving on it, they’re innovating on it, and producing models that are just as good, in some cases, at a fraction of the cost.”  READ ALSO: 7 Best Stocks to Buy For Long-Term\\xa0and\\xa08 Cheap Jim Cramer Stocks to Invest In For this article, we picked 10 AI stocks currently in the news.

Jim Cramer Says He Is Now a ‘Believer’ in Palantir Technologies (PLTR) CEO Alex Karp   everything possible/Shutterstock.com Palantir Technologies Inc. (NASDAQ:PLTR) Number of Hedge Fund Investors: 43 Jim Cramer in a recent program on CNBC praised Palantir Technologies Inc. (NASDAQ:PLTR) and its management and said the stock may turn out to be undervalued in the long term because of its growth.  Story Continues    “I have growing respect for what the company’s trying to do, and I think that even though it seems 100 times earnings, it may turn out to be much less in terms of the multiple. It is the highest—got the highest so-called rule of 40 about its growth and margins of any company. My hats off to these guys. If you go back and read the last couple of analyst reports, it really is the exciting AI company of our era.”  Cramer also appreciated Palantir Technologies (NASDAQ:PLTR) CEO Alex Karp: “I think what really is, this is a very, very high-growth company, and we really don’t know how to value it. We don’t know how to value it because Alex Karp, the CEO, is basically saying, “Listen, our valuation is confused. We’re the fastest growing, but we’re not really going to tell you everything that we do.” I am a believer in Alex Karp. I ordered his book, I’ve read a lot, I’ve seen his videos, and I think that what he’s got here is something that is much more special.”  ClearBridge Growth Strategy stated the following regarding Palantir Technologies Inc. (NASDAQ:PLTR) in its\\xa0Q4 2024 investor letter: “To promote balance, manage risk and augment the portfolio’s growth characteristics, we continued to take profits in some of our more established, larger holdings to seed new purchases.

Are Both Stocks Buys?Geoffrey Seiler, The Motley FoolSun, Jan 26, 2025, 8:30 PM6 min readLink Copied0Analysts at Jefferies recently ranked the so-called \"Magnificent Seven\" stocks based on which ones they thought would outperform in 2025. The name refers to a group of leading mega-cap tech stocks that have been helping lead the market higher the past couple of years.Its top picks among the group were Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) and Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOGL) (NASDAQ: GOOG). The group also includes, by order of Jefferies\\' rankings, Meta Platforms, Apple, Amazon, Tesla, and Microsoft.The firm\\'s rankings were based on several quantitative measures, including growth, valuation, yield, earnings revisions, sell-side analyst sentiment, return on invested capital (ROIC), stock price momentum, and research and development (R&D) versus capex (capital expenditures) spending.Nvidia grabbed the top spot largely due to its strong growth, upward guidance revisions, attractive valuation, and strong analyst sentiment.Let\\'s look at why I think both Nvidia and Alphabet stocks are attractive buys.1. NvidiaNvidia remains a great combination of incredibly strong growth at an attractive valuation. The company is on pace to report its second consecutive year of triple-digit revenue increases, which given its size is quite remarkable.Meanwhile, analysts are projecting more than 50% sales growth in 2025. And it is attractively valued with a forward price-to-earnings ratio (P/E) below 33 times and a price/earnings-to-growth ratio (PEG) of 1. PEGs below 1 are generally considered undervalued, although growth stocks will often have PEGs well above 1.Nvidia\\'s growth comes from a combination of the frantic buildout of artificial intelligence (AI) infrastructure and the wide moat the company has created through its CUDA software platform. Its graphics processing units (GPUs), which were originally created to speed up graphics rendering in video games, have become the backbone of AI infrastructure given their superior processing speeds.As large tech companies and AI start-ups rush to improve their AI models, they need more and more computing power to train them, which is largely coming from GPUs. Through Nvidia\\'s CUDA X collection of libraries, tools, and microservices, its semiconductors are easily programmable for various AI tasks, which has allowed it to take a nearly 90% market share in the GPU space.Elon Musk\\'s xAI is a great example of the growing use of GPUs in AI model training. The company used 20,000 GPUs to train its Grok 2 model, while it originally was using 100,000 GPUs to train its Grok 3 model, but then increased it to 200,000 for phase two of its training. Meanwhile, Musk has talked about xAI\\'s data center hosting a 1 million GPU cluster in the future.Story continuesMeanwhile, Nvidia\\'s largest customer, Microsoft, announced it will spend $80 billion on AI data centers this year. Not to be outdone, a consortium consisting of Oracle, SoftBank Group, and OpenAI has discussed spending up to $500 billion on AI infrastructure in Texas as part of the recently announced Project Stargate.A lot of this spending will undoubtedly go toward GPUs. These projects demonstrate the type of growth still ahead for Nvidia.Image source: Getty Images.2. AlphabetWhile no mega-cap company can come close to matching Nvidia\\'s recent growth, Alphabet is a strong growing company that has the cheapest valuation among the Magnificent Seven with a forward P/E of only 19.4.Last quarter, Alphabet grew its revenue a solid 15%, while its profits soared 34% and its earnings per share climbed 37%. The growth was led by its cloud computing division, Google Cloud, which grew its revenue by 35%.Cloud computing is a business with very high fixed costs that has a lot of operating leverage once the business reaches scale. That was seen in its last quarter, when the segment saw a profitability inflection point, with segment operating income surging from $266 million a year ago to $1.95 billion.With organizations scampering to build out their own AI models and applications, expect this business to continue to grow strongly as Alphabet adds more data center capacity. Meanwhile, the company could see even more operating leverage as it has developed its own custom AI chips with the help of Broadcom, which it has said in combination with GPUs is helping reduce AI inference processing times and lowering costs.As it continues to scale up as the smallest of the big-three cloud computing companies and with its custom chip advantage, Google Cloud\\'s margins should continue to improve, leading to strong earnings growth.At the same time, Alphabet owns the world\\'s dominant search engine in Google and YouTube, the most viewed streaming platform globally. These businesses continue to grow revenue by double digits, with sales for its overall Google Services segment climbing 13% last quarter. Segment operating income soared 29% to $30.9 billion.The company is looking to incorporate its new Gemini AI model throughout its businesses this year to help drive growth, while also looking to promote its Gemini app, which is its answer to ChatGPT.Management also has other emerging businesses that it is investing in, including quantum computing, where it recently announced a big technological breakthrough. It also owns Waymo, which is currently the only company offering paid robotaxi rides in the U.S. These are presently money-losing business, but they have big potential.Overall, Alphabet is a nice combination of growth and value with some solid longer-term optionality with its investments in robotaxis and quantum computing.Don’t miss this second chance at a potentially lucrative opportunityEver feel like you missed the boat in buying the most successful stocks?

The answer was a shockingly low $3,625 at the time I crunched the numbers. Because Nvidia\\'s shares have risen over the last few days, the magic amount is even lower now.In my backward-looking exercise, I also examined what signs might have pointed to Nvidia\\'s potential for massive gains. And there were some good indications about the company\\'s prospects for anyone looking closely.But what about Nvidia\\'s prospects now? Where will the company and its stock be in 10 years? I won\\'t pretend to have any definitive answers. However, I\\'ll take a stab at where I think Nvidia will be in 2035.A prediction of Nvidia\\'s futureThe most important assumption I have about Nvidia\\'s future is that we\\'ve only seen the tip of the iceberg with how artificial intelligence (AI) will impact the world. I suspect more of the iceberg will be visible relatively soon, though, with the adoption of AI agents that can perform tasks autonomously.Could artificial general intelligence (AGI) be achieved within the next 10 years? Probably, depending on how you define AGI. I agree with Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang that AI models will be able to pass any test that humans can in five years or less. I wouldn\\'t go as far as predicting AI systems will be sentient (a criterion some have for AGI) by 2035, though.I fully expect Nvidia to remain a central player in AI over the next decade and beyond. The company\\'s new Blackwell GPU architecture -- which has the most powerful AI capabilities to date -- will likely seem painfully slow and unwieldy compared to what Nvidia will roll out 10 years from now.My future picture of Nvidia includes the company aggressively expanding into areas such as developing custom AI chips. I also think the autonomous ride-hailing market (robotaxis) will explode over the next few years, with Nvidia as one of the top beneficiaries.While AI is Nvidia\\'s biggest opportunity, in my opinion, I believe the company will also see tremendous growth thanks to the adoption of augmented reality (AR) and virtual reality (VR). AR and VR applications will require powerful graphics processors -- and no company is better at it than Nvidia.What could go wrong?Murphy\\'s Law can affect even the best companies. What could go wrong and derail my admittedly upbeat prediction about Nvidia\\'s future? Several things.Competition in the AI chip market will almost certainly increase significantly over the next 10 years. I expect Advanced Micro Devices will further step up its game. I\\'ll also keep my eyes on Nvidia\\'s big customers who have developed their own AI chips, including Google parent Alphabet, Amazon, and Microsoft.Story continuesPerhaps the most worrisome competition, though, could come from major technological breakthroughs by rivals. Nvidia\\'s Huang caused quantum computing stocks to plunge recently with his comments that practical quantum computers are probably 15 to 30 years away. That could be wishful thinking. I can envision a scenario where another company develops a quantum computer that\\'s more powerful for training and deploying AI models than Nvidia\\'s GPUs.As successful as it is (and I think will continue to be), Nvidia isn\\'t immune to macroeconomic factors. If the global economy enters into a deep, prolonged recession, the chipmaker might not grow nearly as much as I expect it will.I\\'d also be remiss without acknowledging that my optimism about the future of AI could be too pie in the sky. Maybe large language models (LLMs) could hit a performance plateau, with no better technologies emerging.The multitrillion-dollar questionSo far, I\\'ve only addressed where I think Nvidia\\'s business will be in 2035. But the multitrillion-dollar question is: Where will Nvidia stock be in 10 years?Before I attempt to answer this question, I\\'ll tell you what I don\\'t think will happen. Over the last 10 years, Nvidia\\'s share price has skyrocketed nearly 285 times higher. I don\\'t see the stock delivering anywhere near that kind of return over the next decade.However, as mentioned, I foresee major growth opportunities for Nvidia over the next 10 years in AI, robotaxis, and AR/VR. Could Nvidia\\'s compound annual growth rate (CAGR) be at least 15% during this period? I think it\\'s possible. If we assume a 15% CAGR, the stock would be a four-bagger by 2035, with a market cap of over $18 trillion.Admittedly, this prediction could be way too optimistic. But even if Nvidia delivers a much lower CAGR of 8%, its stock would more than double over the next decade and give the company a market cap of more than $11 trillion. Unless an unforeseen threat emerges that takes the wind out of Nvidia\\'s sails, the GPU maker\\'s future appears to be very bright.Don’t miss this second chance at a potentially lucrative opportunityEver feel like you missed the boat in buying the most successful stocks?

The semiconductor company is the leading seller of computer chips for artificial intelligence (AI) data centers, which are getting a huge boost in demand. Nvidia\\'s revenue and profits have soared in the last few years, with investors getting uber-bullish on the stock. As of this writing, Nvidia has a market cap of $3.46 trillion, making it the largest company in the world by market value.I think 2025 will be the year the Empire strikes back, with the rest of big tech regaining a negotiating foothold as semiconductor supply chains catch up with demand for AI products. Who will that benefit the most? My bet is Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN), the largest cloud computing company in the world, which is the backbone of many AI tools that are growing like gangbusters.Along with its dominant e-commerce operation, Amazon\\'s cloud computing division will allow it to finish 2025 with the largest market cap in the world. Here\\'s why.Steadily expanding profit marginsUnlike the rest of the big technology companies that already have sky-high profit margins, Amazon\\'s profitability is still vastly understated due to its propensity to invest for future growth. Last year, we started to see the company finally take its foot off the gas, a trend I think will continue in 2025.Over the last 12 months ending in September, Amazon posted an operating margin of 9.8%, a record high. Part of this is due to the Amazon Web Services (AWS) cloud computing segment, which had an operating margin of 35%. I expect AWS margins to remain strong, but the segment is still less than 20% of Amazon\\'s overall sales.Margin expansion is mainly coming from Amazon\\'s dominant North American e-commerce business, which posted an operating margin of 5.9% over the last 12 months. Still at a compressed level -- especially when you consider the tens of billions in high-margin third-party e-commerce fees, subscriptions, and advertising sales it brings in every year -- Amazon has plenty of room to bring segment profit margins even higher in 2025.While it won\\'t be an overnight story, Amazon can easily finish 2025 with a profit margin of 15% and most likely 20%, if it wants. The only question is how efficient its spending on research projects such as Alexa it will be.An artificial intelligence boom for the agesThere is a clear path to Amazon expanding its profit margins in 2025. There is also reason to believe it will keep accelerating revenue growth, especially at AWS.AWS\\'s net sales growth went from 12% in Q3 a year ago to 19% year-over-year growth last quarter. The boom in AI spending should continue in 2025, with capital expenditure budgets seemingly going up every day. This is a good thing for AWS, as more capital expenditures mean more demand for AI computing power, which means more revenue for AWS. In fact, famous investor Softbank announced it will be investing $100 billion in AI in the United States.\\xa0While all of this will not be spent on AWS data centers, the trend is here to stay.Story continuesIf AWS can grow its revenue by 30% over the next 12 months as more and more AI demand gets fulfilled, the division will reach $134 billion in sales and help accelerate Amazon\\'s consolidated revenue growth.NVDA Operating Income (TTM) data by YCharts.Why Amazon can finish 2025 as the largest company in the worldMy belief in Amazon finishing 2025 as the largest company in the world largely rests on an acceleration in revenue growth at AWS and consolidated profit margin expansion. Here\\'s the math that shows why this could occur.Amazon\\'s trailing 12-month revenue is $620 billion, with sales growing 11% year-over-year last quarter. If revenue growth can accelerate to 15% over the next 12 months, that will bring annual sales to $713 billion. It is a staggering size but shows the massive markets Amazon is going after in e-commerce, retail, and cloud computing.As I discussed above, there is room for Amazon to expand its operating margin to close to 20% in 2025. While I\\'m not confident it will hit exactly 20%, there should be high conviction in the general direction of this metric in 2025. If Amazon stopped investing in research projects, the company would likely have profit margins even higher than 20%.The 20% profit margins on $713 billion in revenue equals $142.6 billion in operating income. This is above the operating income generated by Nvidia, Apple, and Microsoft over the last 12 months. While not a guarantee, I think the company that generates the highest profit should have the largest market cap in the world, especially one with promising growth prospects such as Amazon. For this reason, I think Amazon will finish 2025 as the stock with the largest market cap in the world, making it a buy for your portfolio right now.Don’t miss this second chance at a potentially lucrative opportunityEver feel like you missed the boat in buying the most successful stocks?

Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) posted the biggest gain in the Dow Jones Industrial Average, and Palantir Technologies (NASDAQ: PLTR) delivered the top performance in the S&P 500. These players surged 171% and 340%, respectively.Why did investors pile into these stocks? Both have benefited from the artificial intelligence (AI) boom. Nvidia dominates the AI chip market, while Palantir uses AI as a key part of its software-as-a-service platform. As a result, revenue at both companies is soaring.After these successes, you may think it\\'s too late to get in on these top AI players. But we\\'re actually in the early days of the AI growth story, and these companies are well positioned to benefit through the next chapters. Let\\'s take a closer look at these two red-hot growth stocks that remain buys in 2025.Image source: Getty Images.1. NvidiaFirst, some background on this AI giant. Nvidia wasn\\'t always linked to AI. In its earlier days, it was known for its work with the video games industry. The company\\'s graphics processing units (GPUs) drove the lively images key to a great game (and they still do). But it soon became clear that GPUs could be useful in many other industries -- so Nvidia developed the CUDA parallel computing platform to make this a reality.Today, Nvidia serves various industries -- from healthcare to automobiles -- and its main focus is on AI. The data center business makes up the lion\\'s share of revenue, and it looks as if there\\'s a lot more growth to come. Here\\'s why. Nvidia will continue to benefit from the ongoing buildout of AI infrastructure, supplying GPUs and other products. For example, the U.S. just announced a new $500 billion AI infrastructure project and named Nvidia a key technology partner.On top of this, Nvidia is set to gain from the next wave of AI growth: applying AI to real-world situations. Agentic AI -- the use of AI agents to consider problems, reason, and apply solutions -- is a big part of that, and Nvidia has already taken steps here. The company offers blueprints for customers to design their own AI agents.So, today, trading for 49 times forward earnings estimates, Nvidia looks reasonably priced and makes a great growth buy for 2025 and beyond.2. Palantir TechnologiesTwenty-year-old Palantir was once known for its contracts with governments, its biggest customer group. But recently, a new growth driver has emerged: the commercial customer. Palantir sells software that aggregates a customer\\'s data and helps leverage that data to make often game-changing decisions.Story continuesThe company launched a new product, its Artificial Intelligence Platform (AIP), a little more than a year ago, and it\\'s helped this transition happen. AIP integrates AI into the data collection and decision-making processes. Palantir\\'s commercial customers,\\xa0totaling 14 just four years ago, have increased to about 300 -- concrete evidence that AIP is driving growth at Palantir.In even more good news, government revenue continues to increase, too, showing that the company now has two strong growth drivers. In the recent quarter, government and commercial revenue each climbed in the double digits, and Palantir reached its biggest profit ever.AIP is still a relatively new product, and the number of commercial customers today leaves plenty of room for growth. In addition, as mentioned, AI is still in its early stages of growth. Today\\'s $200 billion AI market may surpass $1 trillion by the end of the decade.And though Palantir looks expensive in relation to forward earnings estimates -- its forward price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio is 165 -- a metric that considers growth tells a different story. Palantir\\'s forward price/earnings-to-growth (PEG) ratio of 0.3 is reasonable, considering ratios of more than 1 suggest a stock is overvalued.\\xa0All of this means Palantir remains a solid buy for growth investors in 2025.Should you invest $1,000 in Nvidia right now?Before you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\\xa010 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Nvidia wasn’t one of them.
